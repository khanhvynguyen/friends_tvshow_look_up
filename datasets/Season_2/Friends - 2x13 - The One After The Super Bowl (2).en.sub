{46}{51}I deliver perfection...|and don't brag about it! :D
{51}{80}Previously on "Friends"...
{86}{135}I tracked down Marcel. And get this:
{141}{230}He's here in New York filming|{y:i}Outbreak 2: The Virus Takes Manhattan.
{236}{306}Hey, buddy! Marcel!
{467}{498}Excuse me, this is a...
{504}{619}Closed set. We know.|But we're friends with the monkey.
{642}{672}Good morning.
{678}{711}Look who I brought!
{717}{799}Your old friend, Harry Elafonte!
{847}{921}Whoa, dude. Burn!
{927}{959}I don't get it.
{965}{1015}He seemed so happy|to see me yesterday.
{1021}{1161}Don't take it personal. He's under|pressure, starring in a movie and all.
{1165}{1212}How big of a star is Marcel?
{1218}{1293}In human terms? I'd say...
{1299}{1374}...Cybill Shepherd.
{1414}{1535}So you guys in the movie|or you just really paranoid?
{1541}{1565}Hey, Sal?
{1571}{1622}Jerry wants to know|if the monkey's ready.
{1628}{1649}Excuse me?
{1655}{1721}Jerry is the director?|Which one's he?
{1727}{1798}- The one in the director's chair?|- Gotcha.
{1804}{1897}Pheebs, walk with me.
{1897}{1930}Why am I walking with you?
{1936}{2018}We're just going over here|so that we can get away from...
{2024}{2084}...the horrible flesh-eating virus!
{2090}{2154}For the love of God, woman,|listen to me!
{2160}{2243}Is he looking? Is he looking?
{2294}{2370}The One With the Super Bowl, Part 2
{2376}{2438}English Subtitles by|GELULA & CO., INC.
{3526}{3581}- We've got a problem.|- Tell me.
{3587}{3621}I can't do Chris' makeup.
{3627}{3682}She refuses to acknowledge|her mustache.
{3688}{3764}- Is it bad?|- It looks like her eyebrow fell down.
{3770}{3829}Unless we convince her|to let me bleach it...
{3835}{3916}...Van Damme will be|making out with Gabe Kaplan.
{3922}{3971}I'll talk to her.
{3977}{4033}I hate actors.
{4039}{4170}Nice camouflage. For a minute there,|I almost didn't see you.
{4211}{4268}Excuse me.
{4311}{4345}Is your name Chandler?
{4351}{4385}Yes, it is.
{4391}{4421}Chandler Bing.
{4427}{4504}Do you know me or are you|just really good at this game?
{4510}{4546}I'm Susie Moss.
{4552}{4608}Fourth grade? Glasses?
{4614}{4689}I carried a bo x of|animal crackers like a purse?
{4695}{4721}Susie Moss!
{4727}{4786}Right! Yeah! Wow!
{4792}{4828}You look...
{4834}{4888}Great job growing up.
{4894}{4998}It's nice to see you don't still|wear the cap with the mirrors on it.
{5004}{5093}I graduated fourth grade|and realized I wasn't a pimp.
{5099}{5137}Remember the class play?
{5143}{5285}You pulled up my skirt and the|entire auditorium saw my underpants?
{5287}{5387}Yes. Back then, I used humor|as a defense mechanism.
{5393}{5487}Thank God I don't do that anymore.
{5564}{5611}- Oh, my God!|- What? What?
{5617}{5659}It's Jean-Claude Van Damme.
{5665}{5743}I didn't know he was in|this movie. He is so hot!
{5749}{5774}You think?
{5780}{5857}The Muscles from Brussels?|Wham-Bam-Van-Damme?
{5863}{5895}Did you see "Time Cop"?
{5901}{5935}No. Was he any good in it?
{5941}{6041}Rachel, he totally changed time!
{6054}{6124}So why don't you go talk to him?
{6130}{6206}Go tell him he's cute.|What's the worst that could happen?
{6212}{6275}He could hear me.
{6282}{6344}- I'm doing it for you.|- Don't you dare! Don't!
{6350}{6377}Don't!
{6383}{6446}Tell him I cook!
{6452}{6521}Excuse me.
{6539}{6640}This is gonna sound kind of goofy...
{6643}{6704}...but my friend over there...
{6710}{6779}...who cooks, by the way...
{6785}{6819}She thinks you're cute.
{6825}{6898}You don't think I'm cute?
{6900}{6946}I don't know.
{6952}{7028}Do you think you're cute?
{7048}{7139}We're getting off the track.|I was supposed to tell you...
{7145}{7203}...my friend thinks you're cute.
{7209}{7237}What should I tell her?
{7243}{7392}You can tell her|I think her friend is cute.
{7544}{7646}- Makeup!|- That's me. I gotta go.
{7709}{7857}How many times must I touch you on|the arm before you ask me on a date?
{7867}{7950}Well, let's try one more.
{7956}{8005}There you go. Ernie's, 8:00?
{8011}{8042}I'll be there.
{8048}{8114}And if things go well,|maybe this time...
{8120}{8201}...I'll get to see your underwear.
{8310}{8403}No one was around to hear that?
{8490}{8526}So what'd he say?
{8532}{8573}What a jerk!
{8579}{8697}I kept talking about you,|and he kept asking me out.
{8718}{8821}Naturally, you know, I said no.
{8867}{8887}Thanks, anyway.
{8893}{8931}He just kept asking...
{8937}{9001}...and asking, asking, asking...
{9007}{9087}If you want to go out|with him, you can.
{9093}{9146}Sounds like a jerk to me, but...
{9152}{9263}Jean-Claude, she said yes!|I'll see you tonight!
{9290}{9363}Thank you.
{9466}{9529}Then Jean-Claude took me|to Crossroads...
{9535}{9608}...and we hung out|with Drew Barrymore.
{9614}{9666}Oh, man. She's so smokin'!
{9672}{9752}She's got the greatest set of...
{9806}{9879}No guys around, huh?
{9885}{9954}- Does anybody need anything?|- I'll have an espresso.
{9960}{9982}I'll get it.
{9988}{10101}If I ask you to, you'll end up|drinking it yourself.
{10133}{10184}- That is so unfair.|- I know.
{10190}{10322}Like you'd drink her coffee after|what you did to her with Van Damme?
{10328}{10382}I have to cancel racquetball tonight.
{10388}{10464}Marcel's trainer will let me|have him for a couple of hours.
{10470}{10512}You're blowing me off for a monkey?
{10518}{10582}We can reschedule for Saturday.
{10588}{10684}Unless you hook up|with a bunch of pigeons.
{10690}{10737}Stick a fork in me...
{10743}{10802}...I am done!
{10808}{10839}Stick a fork what?
{10845}{10893}Like when you're cooking a steak.
{10899}{10974}I don't eat meat.
{10983}{11028}How do you know vegetables are done?
{11034}{11107}Well, you don't.|You eat them and you can tell.
{11113}{11191}Okay, then eat me, I'm done!
{11249}{11286}I've met the perfect woman.
{11292}{11358}We're sitting on her couch,|fooling around...
{11364}{11423}...and then she turns to me and says:
{11429}{11507}"Did you ever want to do it|in an elevator?"
{11513}{11536}What did you say?
{11542}{11636}I believe my exact words were...
{11662}{11717}How do you know if you wanna do that?
{11723}{11784}You just know.
{11934}{12035}We gotta go.|Got a reservation in 30 minutes.
{12049}{12172}What I had planned shouldn't take|more than two, three minutes, tops.
{12178}{12283}Two hundred seconds of passion!|We gotta go.
{12287}{12328}But...
{12334}{12401}...here's an idea.
{12407}{12490}Have you ever worn women's underwear?
{12496}{12577}Well, yes, actually...
{12583}{12648}...but they were my Aunt Edna's.
{12654}{12726}And there were three of us in there.
{12732}{12806}I was thinking|it would be kind of sexy...
{12812}{12924}...if you wore mine tonight|at dinner.
{12999}{13064}You want me to wear your panties?
{13070}{13095}Could you?
{13101}{13165}If I was wearing your underwear...
{13171}{13252}...then what would you be wearing?
{13380}{13454}You're swell!
{13479}{13550}I made Marcel's favorite dish,|banana cake...
{13556}{13631}...with mealworm.
{13710}{13769}Candle.
{13775}{13880}What do you think's|gonna happen here tonight?
{13992}{14082}Hi, are you on your way over...
{14169}{14261}No, I understand.|A monkey's gotta work.
{14267}{14296}It's no big deal.
{14302}{14437}It's not like I had|anything special planned.
{14681}{14783}Rachel, why don't you|start talking first?
{14789}{14840}I feel that this is|totally unjustified.
{14846}{14957}She gave me the green light,|I did nothing...
{14975}{15077}Do you think I can't|see you in the TV set?
{15140}{15196}If there's something|you'd like to share...
{15202}{15240}You had no right to date him!
{15246}{15317}- That's the most ridiculous...|- You sold me out!
{15323}{15367}- I did not!|- You absolutely...
{15373}{15457}Would you let me talk!
{15491}{15568}Did you just flick me?
{15570}{15668}Well, you wouldn't let me|finish and I was...
{15674}{15726}That hurt!
{15732}{15760}Quit flicking!
{15766}{15800}Stop flicking!
{15806}{15871}You flicked me first!
{15992}{16062}Let's not do this!
{16109}{16168}Happy thoughts!
{16371}{16448}Now I'm gonna kick some ass!
{16628}{16735}All right. Now, I will|let go if you both stop.
{16741}{16820}You want me to stop seeing him?
{16826}{16906}You want me to just tell him|you're seeing him instead?
{16912}{16998}Is that what you want?
{17015}{17097}That's what you want?
{17122}{17176}- Fine!|- Fine!
{17182}{17238}There we go.
{17244}{17368}If we were in prison,|you guys would be, like, my bitches.
{17555}{17600}Thanks for letting me tag along.
{17606}{17660}Forget about it.
{17666}{17715}How you doing there, squirmy?
{17721}{17765}I'm hanging in.
{17771}{17837}And a little out.
{17878}{17945}So assistant to the director?
{17951}{18043}That's an exciting job. You must|have a ton of responsibilities...
{18049}{18083}I don't do the casting.
{18089}{18171}So what are you guys gonna eat?
{18180}{18279}How come all I can think about is|putting that ice in my mouth...
{18285}{18391}...and licking you all over?
{18400}{18536}Because I went to an all-boys high|school, and God is making up for it?
{18605}{18650}I want you right here...
{18656}{18694}...right now.
{18700}{18744}Right now, right here?
{18750}{18849}Don't you think we're in|kind of a public place?
{18887}{18961}They do have the shrimp.
{18986}{19072}Meet me in the bathroom.
{19191}{19273}I'm going to the bathroom now.
{19467}{19535}Come on.
{19551}{19590}All right, mister.
{19596}{19665}Let's see those panties.
{19671}{19746}Alrighty.
{19796}{19874}But you know what|would be even sexier?
{19880}{19913}What?
{19919}{20026}If you didn't have|your shirt tucked into them.
{20054}{20163}All right. Now, I would like|to see you wearing nothing but them.
{20169}{20224}Take your clothes off.
{20230}{20376}I hope you realize this means|we'll miss hearing about the specials.
{20382}{20403}Come on, hurry!
{20409}{20486}Do you want this done quick|or done right?
{20492}{20591}All right, turn around.|I wanna see you from behind.
{20597}{20696}Somebody's been doing|his "Buns of Steel" video.
{20702}{20825}So you want me|to clench anything or...?
{20849}{20919}Susie?
{20933}{21022}This is for the fourth grade.
{21069}{21112}- What do you mean?|- What do I mean?
{21118}{21143}What do I mean?!
{21149}{21234}I mean underpants, mister!|That's what I mean!
{21240}{21273}What? What do you mean?
{21279}{21308}My skirt...
{21314}{21380}...you lifted. Kids laughing!
{21386}{21483}I was Susie Underpants till I was 18!
{21496}{21611}That was in fourth grade!|How could you still be upset?
{21614}{21746}Call me in 20 years and tell me|if you're still upset about this.
{21831}{21951}I hope you realize you're not|getting these underpants back!
{22153}{22193}I can't believe this.
{22199}{22278}Just two weeks ago,|I was watching "Sudden Death"...
{22284}{22367}...and now I'm on a date|with Jean-Claude Van Damme.
{22373}{22451}Can you beat up that guy?
{22454}{22515}- Can you beat up that guy?|- Sure.
{22521}{22577}This is so wild.
{22583}{22703}I gotta admit, I was surprised|that you agreed to go on a blind date.
{22709}{22784}Normally, I would not do it.
{22790}{22860}What made you make|the exception for me?
{22866}{22892}Rachel told me...
{22898}{22987}...you were dying to have a threesome|with me and Drew Barrymore.
{22993}{23106}By the way, Drew has|some ground rules and...
{23121}{23157}Say you're sorry!
{23163}{23189}Say it!
{23195}{23276}No! I'm not gonna!
{23279}{23376}Say it! Say it!|Great!
{23393}{23499}Say you're sorry|or your sweater gets it.
{23501}{23614}That is my favorite sweater!|That is my third-date sweater!
{23616}{23688}Say you're sorry.
{23694}{23765}You wanna play?|Okay, let's play.
{23771}{23834}Let's play.
{23936}{23959}What'll you do?
{23965}{24070}Give me back my sweater|or it's handbag marinara.
{24111}{24155}You don't have the guts.
{24161}{24288}Yeah? At least I wasn't too chicken|to tell some guy he was cute.
{24496}{24607}Stop! Stop the madness!
{24658}{24695}This is crazy!
{24701}{24810}Who can remember why|you're fighting in the first place?
{24886}{24955}Yes, that's right.
{24974}{25018}But still...
{25024}{25082}Look at your purse!
{25088}{25152}Look at your sweater!
{25158}{25241}Look at yourselves!
{25286}{25336}I'll help you fix your sweater.
{25342}{25375}I'll help you...
{25381}{25462}...throw out your purse.
{25465}{25548}I'm sorry I made you stop seeing him.
{25554}{25675}I'm sorry I went out with him|when I knew you liked him.
{25684}{25794}I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves.
{26253}{26274}Joey?
{26280}{26341}Ma?
{26411}{26492}What are you doing here?|I thought you guys took off.
{26498}{26582}She took off with my clothes!
{26611}{26713}- Are you naked in there?|- Well, not exactly.
{26720}{26801}I'm wearing panties.
{26866}{26934}You always wear panties?
{26940}{27034}No, no. This is the first time.
{27040}{27118}Talk about your bad luck!
{27124}{27247}The first time you try panties and|someone walks off with your clothes.
{27253}{27350}I was not trying them out.|Susie asked me to wear them.
{27356}{27375}Let me see!
{27381}{27466}No! I'm not letting you|or anybody else see, ever!
{27472}{27549}All right, all right!
{27641}{27729}Someone's flossing!
{27831}{27929}Joey, some people don't like that.
{27936}{27977}Chandler's wearing panties.
{27983}{28012}What?
{28018}{28115}- Let me see!|- You don't have to see!
{28121}{28195}Hi, tushy!
{28199}{28271}One of you give me your underpants.
{28277}{28346}I'm not wearing any.
{28373}{28417}How can you not be wearing any?
{28423}{28535}I'm getting heat from the guy|in the hot pink thong.
{28541}{28674}Look, Ross. I'll give you|$50 for your underpants.
{29284}{29347}- Can I have the milk?|- I'm almost done with it.
{29353}{29430}Keep your panties on.
{29544}{29597}And I'm in the movie!
{29603}{29663}- What happened?|- A virus victim called in sick...
{29669}{29797}...so Cathy recommended me and boom!|I'm dying on a gurney!
{29803}{29928}Marcel just finished his last scene,|if you wanna go say goodbye.
{29934}{30069}That's okay. He's probably|got parties to go to and stuff.
{30087}{30209}He's moved on.|That's the way it goes, right?
{30218}{30255}Oh, my God!
{30261}{30318}What?
{30405}{30491}{y:i}Looks like we made it
{30497}{30568}{y:i}Left each other on the way...
{30574}{30651}{y:i}... to another love
{30737}{30826}{y:i}Looks like we made it
{30832}{30904}{y:i}Or I thought so, till today
{30910}{31008}{y:i}Until you were there, everywhere
{31014}{31167}{y:i}And all I could taste was|{y:i}Love the way we made it
{31231}{31325}{y:i}Looks like we made it
{31394}{31496}I think I want to write|a song about all this.
{31502}{31586}Except one of the strings|on my guitar is broken.
{31592}{31663}Chandler, can I borrow your G-string?
{31669}{31789}- How long you been waiting to say that?|- About 20 minutes!
{31890}{32000}Can't you see what's going on here?|This man is dying!
{32013}{32049}Cut!
{32055}{32175}Can't you see what's going on here?|This man is dying!
{32184}{32242}Cut!
{32248}{32370}Can't you see what's going on here?|This man is dying!
{32378}{32434}Mommy!
{32440}{32555}Can't you see what's going on?|This man is dead!
