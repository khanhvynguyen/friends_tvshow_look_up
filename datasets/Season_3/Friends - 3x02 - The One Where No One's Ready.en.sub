00:00:03.14,00:00:05.37
All right, they got water,[br]orange juice. . .

00:00:05.74,00:00:08.01
. . .and what looks like cider.

00:00:08.62,00:00:09.50
Taste it.

00:00:14.42,00:00:15.37
Yeah, it's fat.

00:00:15.62,00:00:16.85
I drank fat!

00:00:18.54,00:00:20.50
I know, I did that two minutes ago.

00:00:24.22,00:00:25.62
Hey, Mr. Tux.

00:00:26.10,00:00:28.33
-Why aren't you dressed?[br]-We have a half-hour.

00:00:28.58,00:00:31.57
That was four minutes ago.[br]We have to be out the door at 7:40.

00:00:31.82,00:00:35.18
Relax, we'll be ready. It takes us[br]two minutes to get dressed.

00:00:35.42,00:00:37.49
I'd feel better if you[br]got dressed now.

00:00:37.98,00:00:39.33
-Okay.[br]-Okay.

00:00:43.02,00:00:44.98
Oh, look at you. All sexy.

00:00:45.22,00:00:46.10
Really?

00:00:51.22,00:00:55.90
-How come you didn't come over earlier?[br]-Because I' m a stupid, stupid man.

00:00:57.38,00:00:59.05
Hey, Ross, want some cider?

00:00:59.30,00:01:00.18
No.

00:01:01.62,00:01:03.29
So you' re pretty close, huh?

00:01:03.50,00:01:05.25
Makeup's on. Hair's done.

00:01:05.50,00:01:06.82
I just have to get dressed.

00:01:07.06,00:01:09.73
And that takes, what?[br]Just 6 or 7 minutes?

00:01:09.98,00:01:12.25
Yeah. Once I figure out[br]what I' m wearing.

00:01:14.94,00:01:16.05
Glass of fat?

00:01:17.78,00:01:19.85

00:02:04.42,00:02:07.17
What's the matter?[br]You nervous about your speech?

00:02:07.42,00:02:08.74
Nope.

00:02:10.22,00:02:12.05
-You wanna hear it?[br]-Am I in it?

00:02:16.82,00:02:19.57
After I thank everyone[br]for donating to the museum. . .

00:02:19.82,00:02:22.46
. . .I sing a song about the wonder[br]that is Joey.

00:02:26.42,00:02:27.93
Hello! You look great!

00:02:28.18,00:02:30.25
Thank you. I know, though.

00:02:31.78,00:02:35.45
You see this? This is a person[br]who is ready to go.

00:02:35.70,00:02:36.81
Phoebe, you. . . .

00:02:37.30,00:02:38.37
You are my star.

00:02:39.42,00:02:41.57
Well, you' re my lucky penny.

00:02:44.42,00:02:49.33
All right, I took the quiz. And it[br]turns out I do put career before men.

00:02:52.02,00:02:52.90
Get up.

00:02:53.38,00:02:54.18
What?

00:02:54.78,00:02:57.21
-You' re in my seat.[br]-How is this your seat?

00:03:00.54,00:03:01.73
I was sitting there.

00:03:01.94,00:03:03.34
But then you left.

00:03:03.90,00:03:06.33
Well, it's not like I went to Spain.

00:03:07.14,00:03:09.37
I went to the bathroom.[br]You knew I'd be back.

00:03:09.62,00:03:11.34
What's the big deal?[br]Sit somewhere else!

00:03:11.54,00:03:14.93
The "big deal" is I was sitting[br]there last! So. . .

00:03:15.18,00:03:16.41
. . .it's my seat.

00:03:16.94,00:03:20.93
Well, actually, the last place[br]you were sitting was in there, so. . . .

00:03:21.42,00:03:23.85
You guys, you know what?[br]It doesn't matter.

00:03:24.10,00:03:28.46
You both have to go get dressed before[br]the big vein in my head pops.

00:03:28.70,00:03:31.37
I just have to do one thing.[br]It's not a big deal.

00:03:31.62,00:03:32.69
Get up!

00:03:35.62,00:03:37.77
Phoebe, you look great!

00:03:38.38,00:03:40.13
All right already.

00:03:41.02,00:03:42.82
Are you gonna do magic?

00:03:45.22,00:03:46.94
That's funny. Change.

00:03:47.14,00:03:48.97
-Hang on, I just got in.[br]-I don't care.

00:03:49.22,00:03:50.94
It starts at 8.[br]We can't be late.

00:03:51.18,00:03:53.93
"He could not, would not,[br]want to wait. "

00:03:54.62,00:03:57.26
Our table is down in front.[br]My boss will be there.

00:03:57.50,00:03:59.77
Everyone will see if we arrive[br]after it starts.

00:04:00.02,00:04:01.90
Has somebody been drinking my fat?

00:04:03.42,00:04:07.01
Does this look like something a[br]paleontologist's girlfriend would wear?

00:04:07.26,00:04:09.73
I don't know.[br]You might be the first one.

00:04:10.98,00:04:13.10
-Rach, did you check the machine?[br]-No.

00:04:13.50,00:04:17.25
Wait. This is the outfit that makes[br]my calves look fat. Never mind.

00:04:20.98,00:04:23.73
Well, Joey, I wrote[br]a little song today.

00:04:24.18,00:04:25.41
It's called, "Get up! "

00:04:26.62,00:04:29.18
All right. You can have the chair.

00:04:29.38,00:04:32.53
-Really?[br]-Oh, my. Would you look at that?

00:04:36.42,00:04:37.85
It's me, I'm coming over.

00:04:38.10,00:04:40.57
What if I'm already there[br]when you play this message?

00:04:40.82,00:04:42.62
Is that too spooky?

00:04:44.58,00:04:46.97
Hi, Rach, are you there?[br]It's me. Pick up.

00:04:47.42,00:04:49.14
Rachel? Rach?

00:04:49.62,00:04:50.77
What?

00:04:52.22,00:04:53.10
Never mind.

00:04:55.50,00:04:57.89
Monica, it's Richard. Call me.

00:05:01.42,00:05:02.90
Is that message old or new?

00:05:04.34,00:05:05.85
Old or new? Old or new?

00:05:06.10,00:05:08.82
It's definitely old.[br]Didn't you hear the double beep?

00:05:09.06,00:05:11.33
What if it's new?[br]We agreed not to talk.

00:05:11.54,00:05:14.21
It could be important.[br]Shouldn't I call him back?

00:05:14.46,00:05:16.73
Honey, you did call him back.[br]It's old.

00:05:16.94,00:05:18.93
Yeah, see, Mon, listen. Listen.

00:05:19.14,00:05:21.18
When Carol and I broke up. . .

00:05:21.42,00:05:24.33
. . .I went through the same thing.[br]You know what I did?

00:05:24.54,00:05:26.45
I got dressed.

00:05:28.94,00:05:31.74
Really, really quickly, okay? Okay?

00:05:31.94,00:05:33.90
There we go. There we go.

00:05:34.62,00:05:36.97
You know what? Don't get up.[br]Just sit there.

00:05:37.22,00:05:40.13
I just hope you don't mind[br]my hand right here.

00:05:41.38,00:05:44.58
Not touching. Can't get mad![br]Not touching. Can't get mad!

00:05:44.82,00:05:46.86
Not touching. Can't get mad!

00:05:47.78,00:05:49.37
Oh, my God!

00:05:49.82,00:05:51.17
You rotten boys!

00:05:52.30,00:05:54.45
-Sorry, Phoebe.[br]-What am I gonna do?

00:05:54.70,00:05:56.45
Don't rub it![br]What gets out hummus?

00:05:56.70,00:05:58.29
What gets out hummus?

00:05:58.78,00:06:00.74
Monica![br]What gets out hummus?

00:06:01.74,00:06:04.94
If it is a new message,[br]what is he calling to say?

00:06:05.74,00:06:07.89
Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that.

00:06:09.42,00:06:11.54
Maybe he called to say[br]you' re obsessive and crazy?

00:06:11.78,00:06:13.90
-So should I call him back?[br]-No!

00:06:15.22,00:06:16.21
No!

00:06:18.22,00:06:21.13
-Fine, we'll both sit in the chair.[br]-Fine with me.

00:06:24.82,00:06:27.09
I am so comfortable.

00:06:28.30,00:06:29.21
Me too.

00:06:29.58,00:06:32.97
In fact, I think I might be[br]a little too comfortable.

00:06:36.98,00:06:40.37
Okay, we have 1 9 minutes.[br]I want you to go and change.

00:06:40.62,00:06:44.66
When you come back, Joey will go change[br]and he'll have vacated the chair.

00:06:45.02,00:06:46.05
-Okay.[br]-All right.

00:06:46.30,00:06:47.78
Fine. I' m going.

00:06:48.02,00:06:51.41
When I get back, it's Chair City.[br]And I' m the guy. . .

00:06:51.62,00:06:53.29
. . .who's sitting in a chair!

00:06:55.30,00:06:56.57
Is this a little too--

00:06:56.82,00:06:58.73
Pheebs? What happened?

00:06:58.94,00:07:00.17
I got the hummus.

00:07:00.42,00:07:04.21
Oh, honey, we'll find you something.[br]You wanna wear my black jacket?

00:07:04.42,00:07:06.54
-It won't go with this dress.[br]-You' re right.

00:07:06.78,00:07:10.98
-Well, let's just get you out of that.[br]-No, no, no. Not "out of that. "

00:07:11.18,00:07:14.30
-Not "out" of clothes.[br]-Can Phoebe borrow your green dress?

00:07:14.50,00:07:15.73
I called him.

00:07:16.54,00:07:19.53
Yes. I got his machine[br]and I left a message.

00:07:19.78,00:07:21.18
But it's okay. It's okay. . .

00:07:21.42,00:07:24.46
. . .because it was, like,[br]a casual, breezy message.

00:07:24.70,00:07:25.69
It was breezy.

00:07:26.58,00:07:28.38
Oh, God, what if it wasn't breezy?

00:07:28.58,00:07:32.78
How could it not be breezy? No.[br]Because you' re in such a breezy place.

00:07:33.50,00:07:37.54
I got it. I'll play my message and[br]you guys tell me if it's breezy enough.

00:07:37.74,00:07:39.73
But how you gonna do that?

00:07:40.34,00:07:42.73
I know the code[br]to his answering machine.

00:07:42.94,00:07:45.37
Okay, Mon, I really don't think[br]this is the--

00:07:45.62,00:07:48.21
Okay, you' re dialing.[br]You are dialing.

00:07:57.98,00:08:01.26
Hi, this is Richard.[br]Please leave a message at the tone.

00:08:02.82,00:08:04.46
You have two new messages.

00:08:04.90,00:08:06.25
What a cool job.

00:08:06.50,00:08:08.38
"You have two new messages. "

00:08:10.18,00:08:12.37
Please pass the pie.

00:08:14.62,00:08:17.13
Hi, it's Monica.[br]I'm just checking in.

00:08:17.34,00:08:20.46
I got a message and didn't know[br]if it was old or new.

00:08:20.70,00:08:22.61
So I'm just checking.

00:08:22.82,00:08:24.38
So let me know.

00:08:24.62,00:08:25.94
Or don't. Whatever.

00:08:26.18,00:08:27.66
I'm breezy!

00:08:29.02,00:08:32.33
You can't say you' re "breezy. "[br]That negates the "breezy. "

00:08:34.50,00:08:37.33
Hola. It's me.[br]Yesterday was really fun.

00:08:38.02,00:08:40.17
Call me about this weekend, okay?

00:08:43.34,00:08:44.90
Now, she sounded breezy.

00:08:48.74,00:08:52.25
He's seeing someone.[br]I can't believe he's seeing someone.

00:08:52.50,00:08:54.93
-You don't know that.[br]-Well, whose voice was that?

00:08:55.14,00:08:58.02
Maybe it was his sister's.[br]Maybe it was his daughter's.

00:08:59.34,00:09:02.49
Michelle. Of course![br]Did it sound like Michelle?

00:09:03.10,00:09:06.93
Oh, great. It's starting to rain.[br]That'll make it easier to get a cab.

00:09:07.90,00:09:08.85
It was Michelle.

00:09:09.10,00:09:10.74
It was definitely Michelle.

00:09:10.98,00:09:14.97
Try Monica's green dress. If it[br]doesn't fit, wear my gray silk one.

00:09:15.22,00:09:17.65
-Unless I wear it.[br]-You don't know what you' re wearing?

00:09:17.90,00:09:20.37
I' m just trying to look nice[br]for your big night.

00:09:20.62,00:09:23.18
Yeah, which we have to leave for[br]in 1 2 minutes.

00:09:23.42,00:09:26.06
Come on, I'll just pick[br]something out for you.

00:09:26.30,00:09:28.45
You'll notice that I' m fully dressed.

00:09:28.70,00:09:31.93
I, in turn, have noticed[br]that you are not.

00:09:32.18,00:09:36.78
So in the words of A.A. Milne,[br]"Get out of my chair, dill-hole. "

00:09:39.14,00:09:40.46
Okay.

00:09:47.82,00:09:50.33
-What are you doing?[br]-You said to give you the chair.

00:09:50.58,00:09:52.54
You didn't say anything about cushions.

00:09:52.74,00:09:54.38
They' re the essence[br]of the chair!

00:09:54.62,00:09:57.13
That's right! I' m taking the essence.

00:09:58.18,00:09:59.93
Oh, he'll be back.

00:10:00.14,00:10:02.45
Oh, there's nobody in the room.

00:10:03.10,00:10:06.57
-I' m sorry, I thought it looked pretty.[br]-That was a Halloween costume.

00:10:06.82,00:10:09.97
Unless you would like me to go[br]as Little Bo Peep.

00:10:10.42,00:10:13.06
I didn't recognize it[br]without that inflatable sheep.

00:10:13.30,00:10:16.93
Yeah, which, by the way, Chandler,[br]I would like back one of these days.

00:10:19.46,00:10:21.97
Rach, good! Listen, isn't this[br]perfect for me?

00:10:22.22,00:10:24.45
Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight.

00:10:24.70,00:10:27.93
Of course, not for tonight.[br]Hi. I' m going to a benefit.

00:10:28.14,00:10:30.13
Not for tonight?[br]What are you doing?

00:10:30.38,00:10:33.58
No, I' m sorry. We didn't mean it.[br]I love you. Breathe.

00:10:34.90,00:10:37.78
We used them as pillows[br]when we went camping.

00:10:37.98,00:10:38.93
What?

00:10:39.90,00:10:41.05
The sheep.

00:10:42.42,00:10:45.09
Hey, what you do on your own time. . . .

00:10:48.62,00:10:50.34
Where's my underwear?

00:10:51.14,00:10:54.45
-Come on, you took his underwear?[br]-He took my essence!

00:10:54.70,00:10:59.33
Okay, hold on. Why can't you just wear[br]the underwear you' re wearing now?

00:10:59.58,00:11:02.09
Because I' m not wearing[br]any underwear now.

00:11:03.22,00:11:05.53
Then why do you have[br]to wear underwear tonight?

00:11:05.78,00:11:07.45
It's a rented tux, okay?

00:11:07.70,00:11:10.85
I' m not gonna go commando[br]in another man's fatigues.

00:11:13.10,00:11:16.38
Then somebody's gonna have[br]to give somebody back his cushions.

00:11:17.18,00:11:21.17
Okay. You hide my clothes, I' m gonna[br]do the exact opposite to you.

00:11:23.42,00:11:26.41
What, are you gonna show me my clothes?

00:11:26.66,00:11:28.01
Hey, opposite. . .

00:11:28.98,00:11:30.13
. . .is opposite.

00:11:31.94,00:11:33.45
He's got nothing!

00:11:34.34,00:11:35.82
Okay, I' m ready.

00:11:40.90,00:11:43.94
Rachel didn't have anything I liked[br]but this ribbon.

00:11:44.14,00:11:46.45
I thought, all right,[br]I'll be political.

00:11:48.18,00:11:51.09
-What are you supporting?[br]-Christmas.

00:11:52.58,00:11:57.33
Hey, that's okay with me. Two down,[br]and I have exactly 1 2 minutes--

00:11:57.82,00:11:58.81
What?

00:11:59.82,00:12:02.25
My watch stopped.[br]My watch. Okay, see. . .

00:12:02.50,00:12:05.22
. . .the dinosaur tail[br]isn't going around anymore.

00:12:05.82,00:12:08.33
What time is it? It's 7:33.[br]I have 7 minutes.

00:12:08.54,00:12:09.65
I have seven minutes!

00:12:09.86,00:12:12.74
Which shoes should I wear?[br]The black or the purple?

00:12:13.02,00:12:15.33
-Just pick one, okay?[br]-Oh, okay, okay. The black.

00:12:15.54,00:12:17.73
Do you have black[br]with little strappies?

00:12:17.98,00:12:21.86
Yeah. But those go better with pants.[br]Maybe I should wear pants.

00:12:22.30,00:12:26.74
Yeah, pants! What an idea![br]Or better yet, go without pants.

00:12:26.98,00:12:29.94
I don't know what you' re doing,[br]but just get in there. . .

00:12:30.18,00:12:32.53
. . .and pick out any shoes[br]that fit your feet.

00:12:32.74,00:12:36.05
I don't care if they match.[br]I don't care if they make. . .

00:12:36.30,00:12:40.74
. . .your ankles or your knees or your[br]earlobes look fat. Just do it!

00:12:40.94,00:12:43.50
Go in there, pick something out[br]so we can go.

00:12:46.18,00:12:48.57
-All right.[br]-Thank you.

00:12:49.42,00:12:52.93
I've got to call Michelle to see[br]if that was her voice.

00:12:53.14,00:12:54.97
It was. It was her voice.

00:12:55.22,00:12:58.13
Monica, I think you've gone over[br]to the bad place.

00:13:02.02,00:13:03.74
Hola.

00:13:04.10,00:13:06.29
Hello? Hello?

00:13:07.62,00:13:10.58
-Okay. That was her, right?[br]-Definitely. Yeah.

00:13:10.82,00:13:12.33
So there you go.

00:13:12.74,00:13:15.94
We' re out of the woods.[br]I think I'll get dressed now.

00:13:17.42,00:13:19.09
-I'll get it.[br]-Okay.

00:13:20.34,00:13:21.74
Hi, Monica and Rachel's.

00:13:22.22,00:13:25.13
Yeah, just a second.[br]Can I ask who's calling?

00:13:25.42,00:13:26.65
It's Michelle!

00:13:28.78,00:13:32.53
She must have that "caller l.D. " thing.[br]You should get that.

00:13:35.42,00:13:36.45
Michelle?

00:13:36.90,00:13:40.73
Yeah, that was me.[br]I dialed your number by mistake.

00:13:40.98,00:13:42.05
Just try to be--

00:13:43.98,00:13:45.33
You' re so sweet.

00:13:46.02,00:13:47.98
Yeah, we were a great couple.

00:13:48.30,00:13:50.10
I know, I really miss him.

00:13:50.62,00:13:53.13
Well, you know how it is.[br]It's just that. . . .

00:13:53.34,00:13:54.93
You know what's weird?

00:13:56.82,00:13:58.81
Donald Duck never wore pants.

00:14:00.22,00:14:01.97
But when he gets[br]out of the shower. . .

00:14:02.22,00:14:04.69
. . .he always puts a towel[br]around his waist.

00:14:07.30,00:14:09.45
I mean, what is that about?

00:14:11.02,00:14:13.77
I only beeped in so I could[br]hear my own message.

00:14:14.02,00:14:15.25
I mean, that's allowed.

00:14:17.94,00:14:22.09
I would really appreciate it if you[br]wouldn't tell your dad about--

00:14:22.30,00:14:26.53
What do you mean, you don't feel[br]comfortable with this? We' re friends!

00:14:27.70,00:14:29.58
That bitch always hated me.

00:14:29.82,00:14:31.14
I' m calling her back.

00:14:33.30,00:14:34.97
-Okay, fine.[br]-Okay.

00:14:36.22,00:14:39.42
-She's got a phone in there, right?[br]-Okay, we' re on it.

00:14:50.02,00:14:53.53
I know it says "black tie optional" . . .

00:14:53.78,00:14:56.34
. . .but this may be pushing it a little.

00:14:56.74,00:14:58.30
I' m not gonna go.

00:15:00.38,00:15:01.57
You' re not gonna go?

00:15:01.82,00:15:05.33
No, I think I' m gonna catch up[br]on my correspondence.

00:15:06.74,00:15:09.49
How can you not be going?

00:15:10.22,00:15:11.45
I' m not gonna go.

00:15:11.70,00:15:15.25
So I think that will accomplish[br]the "not going. "

00:15:19.98,00:15:22.21
You know, just out of curiosity--

00:15:22.62,00:15:25.77
Ever since I was humiliated[br]and yelled at in front of my friends. . .

00:15:26.02,00:15:30.25
. . .I' m just, I don't know, not in a[br]very museum benefit-y kind of mood.

00:15:30.50,00:15:34.33
Right. Well, okay. Okay.[br]God, I' m sorry. I' m sorry I yelled.

00:15:34.54,00:15:36.66
-That's fine.[br]-No, but you' re mad.

00:15:36.90,00:15:38.73
I' m not mad. I' m just not going.

00:15:38.94,00:15:40.37
-Right.[br]-Okay.

00:15:41.62,00:15:44.58
You know that I have to go, right?

00:15:44.82,00:15:49.13
So is it gonna be, like,[br]I' m abandoning you while you' re upset?

00:15:49.34,00:15:50.17
-No.[br]-No?

00:15:50.42,00:15:54.33
-You' re not upset about the yelling.[br]-Right. And the humiliating.

00:15:54.54,00:15:56.53
Well, of course, the humiliating.

00:15:58.54,00:15:59.53
So we. . .

00:16:00.10,00:16:01.17
. . .we' re okay?

00:16:01.42,00:16:03.33
-We' re good.[br]-Right.

00:16:06.58,00:16:08.73
-Honey? I love you.[br]-Yes, Ross.

00:16:10.14,00:16:11.81
Get away from that phone!

00:16:14.42,00:16:16.33
She's just getting dressed now.

00:16:19.38,00:16:22.53
Is it wrong that I was[br]totally aroused by that?

00:16:30.10,00:16:32.53
Okay, buddy boy, here it is.

00:16:32.94,00:16:36.61
You hide my clothes,[br]I' m wearing everything you own.

00:16:37.14,00:16:38.65
Oh, my God!

00:16:40.22,00:16:43.77
That is so not the opposite[br]of taking somebody's underwear!

00:16:44.02,00:16:45.53
Look at me! I' m Chandler.

00:16:45.74,00:16:48.54
Could I be wearing any more clothes?

00:16:50.10,00:16:52.29
Maybe if I wasn't going commando. . . .

00:16:57.22,00:16:59.37
It's hot with all this stuff on.

00:16:59.62,00:17:02.09
I better not do any,[br]I don't know, lunges.

00:17:04.70,00:17:06.97
Okay, enough.[br]Enough with the lunging.

00:17:07.22,00:17:09.73
I' m sick of this.[br]I've had it up to here.

00:17:09.94,00:17:12.33
Neither of you can come to the party!

00:17:12.82,00:17:14.25
Jeez, what a baby!

00:17:15.30,00:17:17.81
Way to ruin it.[br]I was just gonna go get dressed.

00:17:18.06,00:17:20.37
The only person[br]I cared about getting dressed. . .

00:17:20.62,00:17:22.93
. . .is the person who's[br]not even gonna go.

00:17:23.18,00:17:24.98
Look, Rach, I' m sorry, okay?

00:17:25.22,00:17:29.13
Look, I was a jerk, okay?[br]I' m sorry I yelled. I want you there.

00:17:29.38,00:17:30.57
I need you there.

00:17:32.22,00:17:35.97
What can I do to show you[br]how much I want you to be there?

00:17:37.14,00:17:38.94
You could drink the fat.

00:17:41.42,00:17:43.93
Welcome to an adult conversation.

00:17:44.34,00:17:46.53
No, no, no.[br]Now wait a minute. Wait a minute.

00:17:46.78,00:17:50.29
-That actually sounds interesting.[br]-What?

00:17:50.58,00:17:52.62
I think you should drink the fat.

00:17:58.74,00:18:02.57
Okay, if that's what it takes to[br]show you how much you mean to me. . .

00:18:02.82,00:18:05.38
. . .and how much I want you there,[br]that's what I'll do.

00:18:05.58,00:18:08.33
Let me get you another glass.[br]That's been sitting out.

00:18:09.02,00:18:10.93
I think this will be fine.

00:18:12.18,00:18:14.98
Okay, vanilla milkshake.[br]Just a vanilla milkshake. . .

00:18:15.22,00:18:17.94
. . .with chicken bits floating in it.

00:18:21.02,00:18:22.21
Cheers.

00:18:22.42,00:18:24.98
No, don't! Okay, okay, I'll go.[br]I'll go.

00:18:25.22,00:18:26.29
You will?

00:18:27.18,00:18:29.06
You were really gonna do that.

00:18:29.26,00:18:30.06
Well, yeah.

00:18:31.10,00:18:33.17
You were gonna drink the fat.

00:18:36.62,00:18:38.53
Let's see what else he'll do!

00:18:40.30,00:18:43.02
How about you get changed?[br]Give him his underwear.

00:18:43.22,00:18:46.37
I'll get a cab. I want everyone[br]downstairs in two minutes.

00:18:46.58,00:18:47.65
Monica!

00:18:48.30,00:18:49.13
Stop it.

00:18:49.34,00:18:50.49
Stop it!

00:18:54.78,00:18:56.37
Ross went to get a cab, so we--

00:18:56.62,00:18:59.13
What are you doing? No, Monica, no!

00:19:02.30,00:19:03.70
Hi, this is Richard.

00:19:05.50,00:19:07.93
You have three new messages.

00:19:08.94,00:19:10.42
Not anymore.

00:19:11.14,00:19:12.57
Message erased.

00:19:14.70,00:19:18.85
To record your message,[br]begin speaking at the tone.

00:19:19.94,00:19:21.85
Hi, Richard. It's Monica.

00:19:22.10,00:19:24.93
Listen, I did something[br]kind of crazy tonight.

00:19:25.14,00:19:27.94
Maybe I' m getting my period[br]or something. I don't know.

00:19:28.58,00:19:32.05
Anyway, I beeped into your machine[br]and I heard this message. . .

00:19:32.30,00:19:33.70
. . .that freaked me out. . .

00:19:34.30,00:19:36.86
. . .and Michelle will tell you the rest.

00:19:37.10,00:19:41.62
I' m sorry, okay? And I hope that we[br]can just forget the whole thing.

00:19:44.34,00:19:47.85
Your outgoing message[br]has now been changed.

00:19:48.98,00:19:49.86
Outgoing?

00:19:50.10,00:19:51.33
Did that say outgoing?

00:19:51.54,00:19:52.86
Not outgoing!

00:19:55.94,00:19:57.77
Hi, Richard, it's Monica.

00:19:58.02,00:20:00.82
Listen, I did something[br]kind of crazy tonight.

00:20:01.02,00:20:03.61
Maybe I'm getting my period[br]or something. I don't know.

00:20:03.82,00:20:06.17
-How did you do that?[br]-I don't know!

00:20:06.42,00:20:08.41
Goodbye.

00:20:11.22,00:20:15.34
Okay, I've got two cabs[br]and no people! Go, go, go!

00:20:15.54,00:20:18.66
Maybe we can call the phone company[br]to change the message?

00:20:18.90,00:20:20.13
They could change his number.

00:20:20.34,00:20:23.33
I think after this,[br]he'll be doing that himself.

00:20:25.22,00:20:26.02
Rachel!

00:20:31.82,00:20:34.33
You. . . .[br]You look. . . .

00:20:36.74,00:20:39.73
And I still have about[br]five seconds to spare.

00:20:45.62,00:20:47.18
That was about 7 seconds.

00:20:47.38,00:20:48.94
So we' re a little late.

00:20:49.14,00:20:50.86
Come on.

00:20:51.82,00:20:53.57
Oh, and by the way. . . .

00:20:53.82,00:20:54.62
What?

00:20:55.18,00:20:57.14
I' m going commando too.

00:21:07.82,00:21:08.85
Dr. Geller?

00:21:09.14,00:21:12.50
-Sherman Whitfield, London lnstitute.[br]-What a pleasure.

00:21:12.90,00:21:17.37
I was quite impressed with your[br]paper on pre-Cretaceous fossils.

00:21:17.62,00:21:19.77
Yes. It confirmed everything[br]I'd written.

00:21:20.02,00:21:21.34
Excuse me.

00:21:21.58,00:21:22.53
Hi.

00:21:23.10,00:21:23.93
Yes?

00:21:24.38,00:21:26.10
You' re kind of sitting in my seat.

00:21:27.42,00:21:28.98
What do you mean, your seat?

00:21:29.54,00:21:32.34
-I mean, I was sitting there.[br]-But you got up.

00:21:32.54,00:21:34.58
But I never left the room.

00:21:35.30,00:21:37.53
But you left the chair area.

00:21:39.02,00:21:41.74
All right, that's it.[br]Give me your underwear.
