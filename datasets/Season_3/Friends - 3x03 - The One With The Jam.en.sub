00:00:16.77,00:00:20.76
Joe, that's why your parents[br]told you not to jump on the bed!

00:00:22.17,00:00:24.16
The One With the Jam

00:00:25.45,00:00:26.44
Subtitles and Rip by[br].:staz:. (staz@post.cz)

00:01:10.25,00:01:13.32
Hey, look at me![br]I' m making jam!

00:01:13.57,00:01:17.53
-I've been at it since 4 a.m.[br]-Where'd you get fruit at 4 a.m.?

00:01:17.73,00:01:20.53
Down at the docks.[br]You know, you can get it wholesale.

00:01:21.25,00:01:22.97
I didn't know there were docks.

00:01:26.73,00:01:27.92
Is it broken?

00:01:28.13,00:01:30.48
No, but I gotta wear this[br]for a couple weeks.

00:01:30.85,00:01:33.68
You tell the doctor you did it[br]jumping on your bed?

00:01:34.49,00:01:37.64
No. I had a whole story[br]worked out, but then. . .

00:01:37.89,00:01:39.21
. . .Chandler sold me out.

00:01:39.41,00:01:43.32
I didn't think the doctor would buy[br]that it "fell out of the socket. "

00:01:45.69,00:01:47.84
What is this? Fruit?

00:01:51.01,00:01:52.16
Monica's making jam.

00:01:52.77,00:01:57.00
Jam? I love jam! How come[br]we never have jam at our place?

00:01:57.25,00:01:59.24
Because the kids need new shoes.

00:02:00.57,00:02:04.24
I' m going into business. I' m sick of[br]being depressed about Richard.

00:02:04.45,00:02:07.01
I needed a plan.[br]A plan to get over my man.

00:02:07.21,00:02:10.12
What's the opposite of man? Jam!

00:02:12.17,00:02:14.20
Joey, don't! It's way too hot!

00:02:20.97,00:02:22.88
This'll just be my batch.

00:02:40.33,00:02:41.12
That's it.

00:02:41.33,00:02:42.76
Hey, you, J . Crew guy. . . .

00:02:42.97,00:02:44.69
Why are you following me?

00:02:44.89,00:02:47.08
All week, everywhere I look,[br]there's you.

00:02:47.57,00:02:50.69
You wouldn't return my calls.[br]You sent back my letters.

00:02:50.93,00:02:53.04
One more chance, Ursula. Please.

00:02:56.57,00:02:57.64
This is awkward.

00:02:59.53,00:03:03.16
Yeah, because you want Ursula,[br]and I' m Phoebe. Twin sisters.

00:03:04.57,00:03:05.92
Seriously.

00:03:07.37,00:03:09.60
That's great.[br]I' m stalking the wrong woman.

00:03:09.89,00:03:11.96
I am such a dingus!

00:03:12.49,00:03:14.32
Oh, you' re not a dingus.

00:03:14.57,00:03:18.00
I just want you to know[br]I wasn't always like this.

00:03:18.33,00:03:22.56
Before I met your sister, I was a[br]normal guy who sold cellular phones.

00:03:24.49,00:03:27.00
Look, it's not your fault.

00:03:27.21,00:03:30.68
I mean, this is just[br]what she does to guys, okay?

00:03:32.45,00:03:33.60
Well, thanks.

00:03:34.01,00:03:36.28
Wait. I got a little story.

00:03:37.01,00:03:40.28
Once, in junior high school,[br]I thought I was a witch.

00:03:40.97,00:03:45.01
And a guidance counselor told me[br]something that might help you.

00:03:45.41,00:03:48.96
He said, "Okay, you' re not a witch.[br]You' re just an average student. "

00:03:50.33,00:03:52.72
-See what I' m saying?[br]-Not really.

00:03:54.21,00:03:55.56
Well, get over it.

00:03:58.33,00:04:01.48
You seem like a really nice guy.

00:04:02.89,00:04:04.96
Don't be so hard on yourself, okay?

00:04:05.17,00:04:09.16
You' re right. I know you' re right.[br]And thanks for being so nice.

00:04:11.89,00:04:13.37
Thanks a lot.

00:04:14.05,00:04:15.45
Want to get some coffee?

00:04:20.29,00:04:22.72
You don't have to[br]walk behind me anymore.

00:04:28.17,00:04:31.44
"Gone for more jars. Be back later.[br]Monica Geller. "

00:04:32.93,00:04:34.81
Wait a minute. Look!

00:04:36.57,00:04:38.72
It's an empty apartment.

00:04:38.97,00:04:41.96
We' re all alone[br]in an empty apartment.

00:04:42.97,00:04:45.32
I have to be at work[br]in 1 0 minutes.

00:04:46.13,00:04:50.12
All right. It's not like[br]I' m employee of the year or anything.

00:04:55.17,00:04:56.24
There it is!

00:04:56.49,00:04:58.37
Oh, that's what you mean.

00:05:01.29,00:05:02.32
Do I look fat?

00:05:03.05,00:05:04.24
No.

00:05:05.41,00:05:06.44
I accept that.

00:05:06.65,00:05:11.09
When Janice asked me and I said no,[br]she thought I was calling her a cow.

00:05:12.01,00:05:14.84
Walk us through it, honey.[br]Walk us through it.

00:05:15.33,00:05:20.24
Janice said, "Hi. Do I look fat[br]today?" And I looked at her--

00:05:21.69,00:05:23.28
You looked at her?

00:05:25.97,00:05:27.24
You never look.

00:05:28.29,00:05:32.33
You just answer. It's like a reflex.[br]"Do I look fat?" "No. "

00:05:35.09,00:05:37.52
"Is she prettier than I am?"[br]"No. "

00:05:38.61,00:05:39.88
"Does size matter?"

00:05:40.13,00:05:41.48
And it works both ways.

00:05:44.53,00:05:47.52
So you both just[br]know this stuff?

00:05:47.77,00:05:50.97
After 30 or 40 fights,[br]you kind of catch on.

00:05:52.41,00:05:54.16
Okay. For instance:

00:05:54.37,00:05:58.44
Janice is coming back from a trip.[br]She gives you two options.

00:05:58.65,00:06:01.77
Option one: She'll take a cab[br]home from the airport.

00:06:01.97,00:06:05.36
Option two: You can meet her[br]at baggage claim. What do you do?

00:06:05.61,00:06:06.60
Easy. Baggage claim.

00:06:06.85,00:06:08.60
Wrong! Now you' re single.

00:06:11.01,00:06:13.92
It's actually secret[br]option number three.

00:06:14.29,00:06:17.49
You meet her at the gate. That way[br]she knows you love her.

00:06:18.53,00:06:19.85
Okay, this is good.

00:06:20.05,00:06:23.48
All right, I have one.[br]Janice likes to cuddle. . .

00:06:23.69,00:06:26.04
. . .at night,[br]which I' m all for.

00:06:26.33,00:06:29.76
But when you want to go to sleep,[br]you want some space.

00:06:30.21,00:06:32.56
So how do I tell her that without. . .

00:06:32.85,00:06:35.92
. . .you know, accidentally[br]calling her fat or something?

00:06:36.33,00:06:40.48
Sorry, honey. We can't help you[br]there, because we' re cuddly sleepers.

00:06:41.89,00:06:43.45
I' m late for work.

00:06:43.65,00:06:47.04
-Are you guys coming down?[br]-Yeah. I' m right behind you.

00:06:47.25,00:06:49.05
Good luck, Chandler.

00:06:52.73,00:06:54.68
The sleeping thing.

00:06:55.81,00:06:58.24
very tricky business,[br]but solvable.

00:06:58.49,00:07:01.08
I thought you were "cuddly sleepers. "

00:07:03.33,00:07:05.84
No, not cuddly.[br]Not me. Just her.

00:07:06.09,00:07:08.08
I' m like you.[br]I need the room.

00:07:08.37,00:07:09.60
Okay, come here.

00:07:13.41,00:07:15.21
Okay. You' re in bed.

00:07:20.05,00:07:22.08
I'll use the cushion.

00:07:23.69,00:07:27.44
Okay. You' re in bed.[br]She's over on your side, cuddling.

00:07:27.69,00:07:30.60
Now, you wait for her to drift off. . .

00:07:31.01,00:07:32.96
. . .and then you hug her. . .

00:07:33.57,00:07:37.88
. . .and roll her over[br]to her side of the bed.

00:07:38.29,00:07:39.85
And then you. . .

00:07:41.17,00:07:43.12
. . .roll away.

00:07:44.89,00:07:46.56
Hug for her.

00:07:49.61,00:07:51.60
Roll for you.

00:07:53.21,00:07:54.72
The old "hug and roll. "

00:07:55.25,00:07:58.60
One question. You' re pretending[br]the pillow's a girl, right?

00:08:02.61,00:08:06.16
Remember when you were a kid, your[br]mom would send you to the movies. . .

00:08:06.37,00:08:08.88
. . .with a jar of jam[br]and a little spoon?

00:08:12.13,00:08:13.69
You' re so pretty.

00:08:20.53,00:08:24.28
You know that guy who's been[br]following me? I talked to him today.

00:08:24.53,00:08:27.00
You talked to him?[br]Are you crazy?

00:08:29.01,00:08:32.72
First, I' m not crazy.[br]And second, say it, don't spray it.

00:08:33.89,00:08:37.20
Anyway, his name is Malcolm,[br]and he wasn't following me.

00:08:37.41,00:08:40.08
I mean, he was,[br]but he thought I was Ursula.

00:08:42.57,00:08:45.77
That's why he couldn't just[br]come up and talk to me.

00:08:46.69,00:08:49.25
Because of the restraining order.

00:08:51.45,00:08:53.40
Not feeling better about Malcolm.

00:08:55.05,00:08:56.93
No, no, he's not a kook.

00:08:57.25,00:09:01.04
He's just this very passionate,[br]incredibly romantic guy. . .

00:09:01.33,00:09:04.05
. . .that just got[br]a teensy bit carried away.

00:09:04.33,00:09:06.97
We get along really well,[br]and he's so cute.

00:09:07.93,00:09:12.48
Oh, my God! You've got a crush[br]on your sister's stalker.

00:09:13.09,00:09:15.84
I' m going to help him get[br]"de-Ursula-ized. "

00:09:16.09,00:09:19.05
Like I did for Joey[br]after he went out with her.

00:09:19.25,00:09:20.44
I didn't stalk her.

00:09:21.53,00:09:24.00
I asked for the news,[br]not the weather.

00:09:28.17,00:09:31.37
Joey, this is for you.[br]It's blackberry currant.

00:09:37.97,00:09:39.53
Joe, I got to ask.

00:09:39.73,00:09:42.45
The girl from the xerox place,[br]buck naked. . .

00:09:43.45,00:09:45.52
. . .or a big tub of jam?

00:09:47.45,00:09:48.93
Put your hands together.

00:09:52.93,00:09:55.36
Take your time with that.[br]It's my last batch.

00:09:56.09,00:09:57.52
No more jam?

00:09:58.53,00:10:00.52
What happened to[br]your jam plan?

00:10:00.73,00:10:04.12
I figured out I'd need to charge[br]$ 1 7 a jar just to break even.

00:10:04.33,00:10:07.40
So I've got a new plan now.[br]Babies.

00:10:08.65,00:10:11.00
Well, you'll need[br]much bigger jars.

00:10:13.33,00:10:16.48
-What are you talking about?[br]-About me having a baby.

00:10:16.69,00:10:18.84
-Are you serious?[br]-Yeah.

00:10:19.09,00:10:22.21
The jam plan helped me[br]take control of my life.

00:10:22.41,00:10:25.21
So I thought, "What is[br]the most important thing to me?"

00:10:25.41,00:10:28.24
And that's when I came up[br]with the baby plan.

00:10:28.45,00:10:30.80
Aren't you forgetting something?

00:10:31.33,00:10:33.97
What is that guy's name?[br]Dad!

00:10:35.81,00:10:39.20
It took me 28 years to find a man[br]I wanted to spend my life with.

00:10:39.41,00:10:43.32
If I have to wait another 28 years,[br]I'll be 56 before I can have a baby.

00:10:43.53,00:10:45.33
And that's just stupid.

00:10:46.69,00:10:48.49
That's what's stupid?

00:10:50.53,00:10:54.49
I don't need an actual man.[br]Just a few of his best swimmers.

00:10:56.05,00:10:59.12
And there are places[br]you can go to get that. . .stuff.

00:10:59.33,00:11:01.28
Down to the docks again?

00:11:11.05,00:11:13.48
Night-night, Bing-a-ling.

00:11:15.13,00:11:16.64
Night-night. . .

00:11:17.49,00:11:18.64
. . .Janice.

00:11:22.61,00:11:25.00
Look at all the room on her side!

00:11:25.21,00:11:27.20
A giant penguin[br]could fit over there.

00:11:29.33,00:11:30.60
That'd be weird, though.

00:11:32.41,00:11:33.73
Hug and roll time.

00:11:33.93,00:11:36.12
I'm hugging. I'm hugging.

00:11:36.37,00:11:38.64
You're rolling, and....

00:11:39.25,00:11:40.76
Yes! Freedom!

00:11:41.49,00:11:43.32
Except for this arm!

00:11:43.97,00:11:46.16
I'm stuck. Stuck arm.

00:11:47.73,00:11:50.93
Time for the old tablecloth trick.[br]One fluid motion.

00:11:51.13,00:11:52.77
Quick like a cat.

00:11:52.97,00:11:55.44
And one, two...

00:11:56.05,00:11:57.20
... three!

00:12:04.41,00:12:06.13
Here's my binoculars.

00:12:06.33,00:12:08.76
Oh, great.[br]You' re doing great.

00:12:09.05,00:12:11.00
Going strong. Keep going.

00:12:12.25,00:12:14.40
These are my night-vision goggles.

00:12:15.13,00:12:18.72
This is the book I pretend to read[br]when I' m watching her in the park.

00:12:19.61,00:12:22.96
And these are Madlibs.[br]They' re just for fun.

00:12:25.25,00:12:29.08
This is the log I kept,[br]recording her every movement.

00:12:29.77,00:12:31.36
Want to hear some of it?

00:12:31.57,00:12:33.24
Not even a little bit.

00:12:34.65,00:12:35.60
It's about you.

00:12:35.89,00:12:37.48
Okay then.

00:12:42.45,00:12:44.17
"I met Phoebe today.

00:12:44.69,00:12:47.65
She was really nice to me[br]even though I' m such a loser.

00:12:48.89,00:12:51.72
And when I was walking home,[br]I thought about her a lot.

00:12:51.97,00:12:54.88
It was weird, but kind of cool. "

00:12:55.97,00:12:56.96
Good.

00:12:58.37,00:13:00.25
So what were you thinking?

00:13:01.33,00:13:03.84
I was thinking what it'd be[br]like to kiss you.

00:13:04.05,00:13:05.37
-Really?[br]-No.

00:13:08.53,00:13:11.96
That's just something I said now[br]so that maybe I could kiss you.

00:13:12.45,00:13:13.64
Oh, okay.

00:13:19.89,00:13:22.45
No, it's all right.[br]I just had a jar of mustard.

00:13:23.97,00:13:28.80
Okay. Sperm donor number 0381 5,[br]come on down!

00:13:29.93,00:13:31.65
Okay, he's 6' 2", 1 70 pounds.

00:13:31.89,00:13:34.85
He describes himself[br]as a male Gina Davis.

00:13:35.09,00:13:36.97
You mean there's[br]more than one of us?

00:13:38.77,00:13:41.89
You can't do this, Mon.[br]If you do this, I'll--

00:13:42.13,00:13:44.64
-You'll what?[br]-I'll tell Mom.

00:13:45.65,00:13:49.20
I' m sorry, but he's right.[br]I love you, but you' re crazy.

00:13:49.53,00:13:51.96
Why? Why is this crazy?

00:13:52.37,00:13:54.80
-So this isn't the ideal way--[br]-Oh, it's not--

00:13:55.05,00:13:56.77
Lips moving. Still talking.

00:13:57.97,00:13:59.92
It may not be ideal, but. . .

00:14:00.17,00:14:01.89
. . .I' m so ready.

00:14:02.45,00:14:04.52
I see the way[br]Ben looks at you.

00:14:05.09,00:14:07.36
It makes me ache, you know?

00:14:07.85,00:14:09.68
Check it out! Jam crackers!

00:14:13.85,00:14:15.92
Okay. All right, how's this?

00:14:16.17,00:14:18.84
Twenty-seven, ltalian-American guy.

00:14:19.09,00:14:20.60
He's an actor.

00:14:20.89,00:14:22.48
Born in Queens.

00:14:22.73,00:14:25.80
Wow! Big family.[br]Seven sisters. . .

00:14:26.69,00:14:28.72
. . .and he's the only. . .boy.

00:14:32.89,00:14:36.32
Oh, my God! Under personal comments:[br]"New York Knicks rule. "

00:14:36.53,00:14:38.01
Yeah, the Knicks rule!

00:14:41.85,00:14:43.65
Joey, this is you!

00:14:44.25,00:14:45.48
Let me see.

00:14:47.85,00:14:48.92
Oh, right!

00:14:50.21,00:14:51.88
You went to a sperm bank?

00:14:52.09,00:14:54.76
Right after I did that[br]sex study at NYU.

00:14:54.97,00:14:56.61
Remember that sweater I gave you?

00:14:57.65,00:14:59.72
That's how you bought it?

00:15:00.73,00:15:03.64
No. That's what I was wearing[br]when I donated.

00:15:06.77,00:15:09.65
I' m surprised there's any[br]of my boys left.

00:15:10.37,00:15:14.16
It is pretty competitive. There's[br]an actual rocket scientist here.

00:15:14.37,00:15:18.20
Maybe I should have them put my[br]Days of our Lives gig on here.

00:15:18.73,00:15:20.37
Juice this up a little.

00:15:23.57,00:15:25.21
How's the maniac?

00:15:25.65,00:15:28.08
He's yummy.[br]We did a little kissing.

00:15:29.41,00:15:31.21
Phoebe, what are you doing?

00:15:31.45,00:15:35.60
No, no. He's not into that anymore.[br]He quit for me.

00:15:36.65,00:15:40.88
This guy has been obsessed with[br]your sister for God knows how long.

00:15:41.09,00:15:43.65
You don't just give that up.

00:15:44.09,00:15:47.13
He gave me his night-vision[br]goggles and everything.

00:15:48.05,00:15:51.84
You' re taking the word of a guy[br]who has night-vision goggles?

00:15:52.09,00:15:55.76
He's not still following her.[br]You think he's still following her?

00:15:55.97,00:15:58.88
Wake up and smell[br]the restraining order.

00:16:00.77,00:16:02.00
What should I do?

00:16:02.25,00:16:05.13
If you really like this guy,[br]you should just trust him.

00:16:05.37,00:16:06.85
Thank you, Monica.

00:16:07.37,00:16:09.20
Or you could follow him.

00:16:09.41,00:16:11.48
That's what I'd do.[br]Forget mine.

00:16:14.97,00:16:16.16
What happened?

00:16:16.41,00:16:18.64
Crazy Chandler spun me. . .

00:16:18.85,00:16:20.36
. . .off the bed.

00:16:20.69,00:16:23.28
Wow! Spinning![br]Sounds like fun.

00:16:25.37,00:16:26.72
I wish.

00:16:26.97,00:16:30.36
He was just trying[br]Ross' "hug and roll" thing.

00:16:33.93,00:16:35.20
Ross' what?

00:16:35.41,00:16:38.64
Where he hugs you[br]and then he rolls you away, and. . . .

00:16:42.09,00:16:45.24
Oh. . .my. . .God!

00:17:21.09,00:17:22.12
What are you doing?

00:17:22.53,00:17:25.49
Oh, I was just here looking[br]for my. . .my. . . .

00:17:25.81,00:17:27.92
Part of an old sandwich.[br]Here it is!

00:17:30.53,00:17:32.12
Were you following me?

00:17:32.81,00:17:34.08
Perhaps.

00:17:35.65,00:17:37.53
Yes. I' m sorry.

00:17:37.73,00:17:40.69
I was afraid you were still[br]hung up on my sister.

00:17:40.89,00:17:42.72
So you spied on me.

00:17:43.61,00:17:45.60
I can't believe[br]you don't trust me.

00:17:51.21,00:17:55.36
Well, what do you know?[br]There goes my identical twin sister!

00:17:55.65,00:17:58.12
Just walking along, looking like me.

00:17:59.53,00:18:03.28
Is this a freakish coincidence, or[br]did you know she takes this train?

00:18:03.81,00:18:05.56
I' m sorry. I' m sorry.

00:18:06.09,00:18:08.40
I tried to stop,[br]but I couldn't.

00:18:09.01,00:18:10.65
I' m so pathetic.

00:18:10.85,00:18:14.60
No, it's not your fault.[br]It's partly my fault.

00:18:14.97,00:18:17.32
I made you quit cold turkey.

00:18:18.89,00:18:22.40
Well, I can't date you anymore[br]because you' re, you know. . . .

00:18:22.61,00:18:23.76
Wow!

00:18:25.77,00:18:29.73
But I will definitely help you[br]get over my sister. Okay?

00:18:30.57,00:18:32.72
Stalk me for a while, huh?

00:18:34.81,00:18:36.88
I'll be like an Ursula patch.

00:18:38.13,00:18:39.16
I don't know.

00:18:39.45,00:18:41.56
Just. . . .[br]Look, I' m going!

00:18:42.33,00:18:43.08
Come on.

00:18:44.57,00:18:47.48
I' m on the pillar.[br]Which way will I go?

00:18:50.93,00:18:52.88
-Where you going?[br]-To the bank.

00:18:53.37,00:18:55.04
Sperm or regular?

00:18:56.45,00:18:57.88
Sperm.

00:18:58.13,00:18:59.40
You' re really doing it?

00:18:59.65,00:19:02.32
Oh, yeah. I picked a guy.[br]37 1 35.

00:19:02.97,00:19:04.16
Sounds nice.

00:19:04.41,00:19:07.08
He does. He's got[br]brown hair and green eyes.

00:19:07.29,00:19:08.69
No kidding?

00:19:10.09,00:19:11.92
I figured you'd have picked[br]a blond.

00:19:12.53,00:19:13.96
Really? Why?

00:19:14.57,00:19:19.32
I always pictured you with a tall,[br]smart, blond guy with a name like. . .

00:19:19.57,00:19:20.36
. . .Hoyt.

00:19:22.97,00:19:24.12
It's a name. Yeah.

00:19:25.81,00:19:29.64
I saw you in this great house[br]with a big pool.

00:19:30.57,00:19:32.08
Is he a swimmer?

00:19:33.01,00:19:34.44
He's got the body for it.

00:19:35.61,00:19:37.01
I like that.

00:19:40.01,00:19:40.60
What?

00:19:40.89,00:19:42.84
You have a sign that says:

00:19:43.05,00:19:46.04
"We don't swim in your toilet.[br]Don't pee in our pool. "

00:19:46.25,00:19:47.76
We don't have that sign.

00:19:48.01,00:19:49.49
You do![br]It was a gift from me.

00:19:51.93,00:19:53.81
And you have three great kids.

00:19:54.01,00:19:55.68
Two girls and a boy?

00:19:57.49,00:20:01.61
And they wear little water wings,[br]and they run around on the deck.

00:20:01.81,00:20:04.45
And Hoyt wraps a towel[br]around all three of them.

00:20:04.65,00:20:05.48
Sure.

00:20:11.69,00:20:14.52
But, you know,[br]this way sounds good too.

00:20:16.25,00:20:17.32
Yeah.

00:20:29.53,00:20:31.68
Wow! This guy's an astronaut?

00:20:33.25,00:20:35.24
That would have been cool. . .

00:20:35.97,00:20:37.48
. . .for a day.

00:20:44.81,00:20:46.24
I called the sperm bank.

00:20:46.49,00:20:49.45
They haven't sold a single unit[br]of Tribbiani.

00:20:49.89,00:20:51.53
Nobody wants my product.

00:20:53.45,00:20:55.28
I don't get it.

00:21:01.53,00:21:03.36
Maybe if they met me in person.

00:21:05.13,00:21:06.72
You got a thing on your. . . .

00:21:11.33,00:21:12.12
Get it?

00:21:13.29,00:21:14.40
Yeah.

00:21:16.53,00:21:17.68
Hello.

00:21:19.45,00:21:20.52
Hello.

00:21:28.65,00:21:30.92
Chan, can I talk to you[br]for a second?

00:21:31.13,00:21:32.48
Sure. What's up?

00:21:33.25,00:21:36.05
Just one additional[br]relationship thought.

00:21:36.25,00:21:38.56
Something you' re probably aware of.

00:21:39.17,00:21:40.68
Women talk.
