00:00:06.22,00:00:09.22
Welcome, everybody![br]Welcome to Amazing Discoveries!

00:00:10.58,00:00:11.78
It's on again!

00:00:11.98,00:00:14.21
Guys, could we please[br]not watch this?

00:00:14.94,00:00:18.06
This ever happen to you?[br]You go to get a glass of milk...

00:00:18.30,00:00:21.46
...but these cartons are so[br]flinging, flanging hard to open!

00:00:21.66,00:00:23.46
Boy, you said it, Mike.

00:00:25.98,00:00:29.22
-There's gotta be a better way.[br]-There is, Kevin!

00:00:29.66,00:00:32.78
-Can we please turn this off?[br]-No way, Kevin!

00:00:32.98,00:00:36.45
What if I told you there's[br]a new product that guarantees...

00:00:36.70,00:00:39.46
... you'll never have to open up[br]milk cartons again?

00:00:39.70,00:00:41.82
Meet the Milkmaster 2000!

00:00:43.98,00:00:46.54
-Intrigued?[br]-You' re flinging, flanging right I am!

00:00:48.22,00:00:52.54
This is the first time he's used this.[br]You'll see how easy this is to do.

00:00:53.38,00:00:56.34
-This works in any milk carton.[br]-Wow, it is easy!

00:00:56.54,00:00:58.82
Now I can have milk every day.

00:01:02.30,00:01:04.37
The One With the Metaphorical Tunnel

Subtitles and Rip by[br].:staz:. (staz@post.cz)

00:01:50.30,00:01:52.61
It's official.[br]There are no good movies.

00:01:52.82,00:01:55.29
So let's go to a bad one,[br]and make out.

00:01:59.42,00:02:03.82
Perhaps you'd like me to turn[br]so you can bunny-bump against my back?

00:02:06.82,00:02:09.62
-Hey, man. What's up?[br]-Maybe you can tell me.

00:02:09.86,00:02:13.33
My agent wants to know why I didn't[br]show up at my audition today. . .

00:02:13.58,00:02:17.02
. . .my first good one in weeks.[br]How could you not give me the message?

00:02:17.22,00:02:19.78
I'll tell you, I do enjoy guilt. . .

00:02:20.30,00:02:21.94
. . .but it wasn't me.

00:02:22.18,00:02:24.02
Yes, it was.[br]It was him!

00:02:25.86,00:02:27.18
Okay, it was me!

00:02:29.26,00:02:32.46
-How was it you?[br]-Well, it was all so crazy, you know?

00:02:32.70,00:02:35.46
Chandler was in the closet,[br]counting to 1 0. . .

00:02:35.70,00:02:37.66
. . .and I hadn't found a place[br]to hide yet.

00:02:39.10,00:02:43.22
I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all[br]down on my hand. See? All of it.

00:02:43.66,00:02:45.42
Yep, that's my audition.

00:02:45.70,00:02:48.42
See? Now, this is why I keep[br]notepads everywhere.

00:02:48.62,00:02:51.42
Yep. And that's why we don't[br]invite you to play.

00:02:52.46,00:02:55.82
What is the great tragedy here?[br]Get yourself another appointment.

00:02:56.06,00:02:59.85
Estelle tried. The casting director[br]told her I missed my chance.

00:03:00.10,00:03:01.25
Well, that is unfair!

00:03:01.66,00:03:04.02
I'll call her.[br]I'll tell her it was my fault.

00:03:04.22,00:03:07.02
You can't. The casting director[br]doesn't talk to friends.

00:03:07.22,00:03:10.38
-She only talks to agents.[br]-What a sad little life she must lead.

00:03:13.90,00:03:16.62
-What are you doing?[br]-No, I know, I know.

00:03:17.86,00:03:21.14
Hi, this is Caitlin[br]from Phoebe Buffay's office.

00:03:22.18,00:03:24.65
Is Anne there for Phoebe?

00:03:25.06,00:03:27.10
She'll know what it's about.

00:03:27.30,00:03:28.70
Hang up. Hang up right--

00:03:30.62,00:03:34.06
Annie? Hi. Listen, we've got[br]a problem with Joey Tribbiani.

00:03:34.30,00:03:37.61
Apparently, he missed his audition.[br]Who did you speak to in my office?

00:03:37.86,00:03:39.93
Estelle? I don't know[br]what to do with her.

00:03:40.18,00:03:44.30
So your husband leaves and burns down[br]the apartment. The world doesn't stop.

00:03:45.42,00:03:46.94
Is anybody else scared?

00:03:48.46,00:03:52.22
If Joey loses this audition, then[br]that is it for Estelle. I don't care!

00:03:53.18,00:03:56.86
Annie, you are a doll. What time can[br]you see him? I need a pen. Pen!

00:04:03.50,00:04:06.97
Get the woman a pad![br]Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!

00:04:07.42,00:04:09.98
Oh, now you want a pad.

00:04:14.62,00:04:16.46
Where's my boy?

00:04:16.70,00:04:18.66
Here's my boy!

00:04:18.90,00:04:21.74
And here's his Barbie!

00:04:27.66,00:04:29.54
What's my boy doing with a Barbie?

00:04:30.58,00:04:33.05
He picked it out at the store.[br]He loves it.

00:04:33.30,00:04:35.74
He carries it everywhere,[br]like a security blanket.

00:04:35.98,00:04:38.58
But with ski boots and a kicky beret.

00:04:39.78,00:04:41.42
Yeah, it's cute.

00:04:41.62,00:04:44.46
Why does he have it again?

00:04:44.70,00:04:46.77
So he's got a doll. So what?

00:04:48.30,00:04:51.66
Unless you' re afraid[br]he's gonna grow up to be. . .

00:04:51.90,00:04:53.46
. . .in show business.

00:04:54.06,00:04:55.94
This wouldn't have[br]to do with the fact. . .

00:04:56.18,00:04:58.22
. . .that he's being raised[br]by two women?

00:04:59.58,00:05:04.26
You know what? It's fine. If you' re[br]okay with the Barbie thing, so am l.

00:05:04.50,00:05:07.62
Give Daddy the Barbie.[br]Give me the Barbie.

00:05:07.82,00:05:10.82
Don't you wanna play[br]with a monster truck?

00:05:12.10,00:05:13.33
No? Okay.

00:05:13.90,00:05:16.70
How about a Dino-Soldier?

00:05:21.62,00:05:22.90
You are so pathetic.

00:05:23.14,00:05:26.22
Why can't your son[br]just play with his doll?

00:05:32.50,00:05:34.10
I gotta go to work.

00:05:35.70,00:05:37.34
Has anybody seen my left boob?

00:05:39.26,00:05:40.78
I loved that movie.

00:05:44.78,00:05:46.74
Here it is.[br]What are you doing?

00:05:47.46,00:05:49.50
I' m sorry. It just felt nice.

00:05:53.30,00:05:54.45
Answer the phone.

00:05:54.82,00:05:58.26
I only got one arm. You should[br]do stuff for me. Get me a sweater.

00:05:59.70,00:06:01.22
Just do it! It's Janice.

00:06:01.46,00:06:03.82
And if I get it, I'll have[br]to see her tonight.

00:06:05.90,00:06:08.13
That's great.[br]I'll have to see her tonight.

00:06:08.38,00:06:10.50
Why don't you want to see Janice?

00:06:10.74,00:06:12.81
Last night at dinner,[br]when the meals came. . .

00:06:13.06,00:06:17.62
. . .she put half her chicken piccata[br]on my plate and took all my tomatoes.

00:06:19.46,00:06:21.38
And that's bad. . .

00:06:21.66,00:06:23.86
. . .because you hate chicken piccata?

00:06:25.78,00:06:29.62
You didn't want to share your tomatoes.[br]Tomatoes are very important to you.

00:06:30.18,00:06:32.02
Suddenly, we were this "couple. "

00:06:32.22,00:06:34.66
And this alarm started going off[br]in my head.

00:06:34.90,00:06:36.97
"Run for your life![br]Get out of the building! "

00:06:38.42,00:06:40.10
Men are unbelievable.

00:06:40.34,00:06:41.82
What is it with you people?

00:06:42.06,00:06:44.90
The minute you feel something,[br]you have to run away?

00:06:45.38,00:06:46.61
I know. That--

00:06:48.46,00:06:52.74
That's why I don't want to go tonight.[br]I' m afraid I'll say something stupid.

00:06:52.94,00:06:56.02
You mean that "guy thing" where[br]you act mean and distant. . .

00:06:56.22,00:06:57.86
. . .until we break up with you?

00:06:58.14,00:06:59.29
You know about that?

00:07:01.10,00:07:02.62
What do I do?[br]I wanna get past this.

00:07:02.86,00:07:05.01
I don't want to be afraid[br]of commitment.

00:07:05.26,00:07:08.62
I want to go through the tunnel[br]to the other side!

00:07:09.58,00:07:11.78
Where there's no fear of commitment.

00:07:12.90,00:07:14.18
Do we have any--

00:07:18.90,00:07:20.38
Do we have any thoughts here?

00:07:20.90,00:07:23.26
I've never been through[br]the tunnel myself because. . .

00:07:23.50,00:07:26.78
. . .you' re not allowed through[br]with more than one girl in the car.

00:07:28.98,00:07:33.06
But it seems to me it's pretty much[br]like anything else. Face your fear.

00:07:33.30,00:07:36.06
Fear of heights?[br]Go to the top of the building.

00:07:36.30,00:07:37.62
You' re afraid of bugs.

00:07:38.82,00:07:40.05
Get a bug.

00:07:42.74,00:07:44.42
You have a fear of commitment.

00:07:44.62,00:07:48.86
So I say you go in there and you be[br]the most committed guy there ever was!

00:07:49.10,00:07:51.25
Amazingly, that makes sense.

00:07:52.10,00:07:54.94
-Do you think?[br]-Oh, yeah! Go for it, man!

00:07:55.18,00:07:56.25
Jump off the high dive!

00:07:56.50,00:08:00.02
Stare down the barrel of the gun![br]Pee into the wind!

00:08:01.70,00:08:04.01
If I' m staring down[br]the barrel of a gun. . .

00:08:04.22,00:08:06.98
. . .I' m gonna be pretty much peeing[br]every which way.

00:08:12.22,00:08:14.45
It's your audition from this morning!

00:08:14.98,00:08:16.02
Can I use the phone?

00:08:16.26,00:08:20.62
Sure, that's what it's there for.[br]Emergencies and pretend agents.

00:08:21.66,00:08:23.10
Come on, baby! Come on!

00:08:25.10,00:08:27.94
Hi. I have Phoebe Buffay[br]returning a page.

00:08:28.18,00:08:31.54
Okay, she's in her car.[br]I'll have to patch you through.

00:08:31.78,00:08:33.38
very nice touch.

00:08:34.70,00:08:35.90
Okay, go ahead.

00:08:37.38,00:08:38.53
Talk, talk, talk!

00:08:39.90,00:08:40.94
Hi, Annie?

00:08:41.50,00:08:42.73
Fantastic. You got it!

00:08:45.58,00:08:49.90
Will he work for scale, you ask me?[br]Well, I don't know about that.

00:08:50.14,00:08:52.02
Except that I do and he will.

00:08:52.70,00:08:54.98
Great. Oh, you are such a sweetheart.

00:08:55.30,00:08:57.34
I would love to have lunch with you!

00:08:57.62,00:09:00.34
How about we have lunch next--

00:09:00.58,00:09:02.02
Went through a tunnel.

00:09:02.70,00:09:03.66
Unbelievable.

00:09:03.90,00:09:05.58
Oh, thank you so much!

00:09:06.02,00:09:10.06
It was really fun. I mean, I've never[br]talked on a car phone before.

00:09:10.90,00:09:13.62
You are so amazing![br]Could you do me this huge favor?

00:09:13.86,00:09:17.22
There's another audition I want,[br]and Estelle couldn't get me in.

00:09:17.46,00:09:19.82
I don't know.[br]It was fun one time, but--

00:09:20.06,00:09:22.34
Please? It would just be[br]this one more.

00:09:22.58,00:09:23.94
Well, actually it's two.

00:09:24.18,00:09:25.22
Two?

00:09:25.46,00:09:26.90
Well, really it's three.

00:09:27.30,00:09:30.61
Please? You' re so good at it.[br]I love you.

00:09:31.70,00:09:33.46
Okay. But just these three, right?

00:09:33.70,00:09:34.93
No, it's four.

00:09:39.22,00:09:41.26
So how come you wanted[br]to eat in tonight?

00:09:42.02,00:09:44.02
Because I wanted. . .

00:09:44.22,00:09:45.74
. . .to give you this.

00:09:47.22,00:09:49.66
Are you a puppy!

00:09:54.10,00:09:55.42
Contact paper!

00:09:57.02,00:09:59.62
What do you say when someone[br]you' re sleeping with. . .

00:09:59.82,00:10:01.54
. . .gives you contact paper?

00:10:02.22,00:10:06.34
Wait, there's more.[br]See, the contact paper is to go. . .

00:10:06.58,00:10:08.62
. . .in your brand new drawer!

00:10:11.22,00:10:13.45
See, the drawer actually[br]goes in my dresser.

00:10:14.42,00:10:17.02
You didn't have to do this.

00:10:17.50,00:10:18.57
Yes, I did.

00:10:18.78,00:10:21.14
Yes, I did.[br]Because you' re my girlfriend. . .

00:10:21.38,00:10:24.10
. . .and that's what girlfriends[br]should get.

00:10:26.10,00:10:28.49
Well, I gotta buy a vowel. . .

00:10:30.10,00:10:32.62
. . .because, oh, my God!

00:10:33.82,00:10:35.89
Who would've thought that someday. . .

00:10:36.10,00:10:39.02
. . .Chandler Bing would buy me[br]a drawer?

00:10:40.38,00:10:41.42
Well, not me.

00:10:43.26,00:10:46.38
But that's what's happened.[br]And there's more.

00:10:48.30,00:10:49.94
We should take a trip.

00:10:50.66,00:10:51.65
We should?

00:10:51.90,00:10:54.37
We' re a couple,[br]and that's what couples do.

00:10:55.06,00:10:56.94
And I wanna meet your parents.

00:10:57.18,00:10:59.90
We should take a trip[br]with your parents!

00:11:03.86,00:11:08.22
I don't think we need to because[br]you' re tripping me out right now!

00:11:09.18,00:11:10.25
Are you okay?

00:11:10.50,00:11:11.30
No, I am.

00:11:11.98,00:11:13.82
I actually am! This is amazing.

00:11:14.02,00:11:17.14
My entire life, I have feared[br]this place.

00:11:17.38,00:11:19.85
And now that I' m here, it's like,[br]what was the big deal?

00:11:20.10,00:11:23.86
I could probably say, "Let's move in[br]together," and I'd be okay.

00:11:24.30,00:11:26.53
You probably want us[br]to move in together?

00:11:27.70,00:11:30.74
-It doesn't scare me![br]-Yeah, well it scares me!

00:11:30.98,00:11:34.66
I' m not even divorced yet! You just[br]invited me over here for pasta. . .

00:11:34.90,00:11:37.82
. . .and now you' re talking[br]about moving in together.

00:11:38.06,00:11:39.86
And I wasn't even that hungry.

00:11:40.10,00:11:43.86
You know what? It's getting really[br]late, and I should just--

00:11:44.10,00:11:46.86
Don't go! I've scared you![br]I've said too much!

00:11:47.10,00:11:50.02
I' m hopeless and awkward[br]and desperate for love!

00:11:56.86,00:11:58.54
Hey, Janice, it's me.

00:11:59.98,00:12:03.74
I wanted to apologize in advance[br]for having chased you down the street.

00:12:10.66,00:12:12.81
Here you go, honey. This will help.

00:12:13.62,00:12:15.54
So I catch up to her[br]and she says. . .

00:12:15.78,00:12:19.09
. . .this relationship's going too fast[br]and we have to slow down.

00:12:19.30,00:12:20.86
That is never good.

00:12:21.06,00:12:22.34
Then I got all. . .

00:12:23.26,00:12:24.66
. . .needy and clingy.

00:12:25.46,00:12:29.09
Wait a minute. Maybe it's[br]not so bad. How did you leave it?

00:12:29.34,00:12:31.26
She said she'd call me.

00:12:33.46,00:12:34.78
Oh, God.

00:12:35.30,00:12:37.37
Welcome to our side of the tunnel.

00:12:38.62,00:12:40.82
This ice cream tastes like crap,[br]by the way.

00:12:41.02,00:12:44.41
Well, it's that[br]low-cal-nondairy-soymilk junk.

00:12:44.62,00:12:47.46
We save the real stuff[br]for the truly terminal cases.

00:12:48.22,00:12:51.69
When you' re getting screwed over all[br]the time, you gotta switch to low fat.

00:12:51.94,00:12:53.01
Yeah, you do.

00:12:53.90,00:12:56.42
You don't think I' m terminal?

00:12:56.62,00:13:00.22
Not at all. You' re not terminal.[br]We just need some damage control.

00:13:00.42,00:13:02.22
Okay. Should I call her?

00:13:05.06,00:13:08.45
It's a critical time. If you feel[br]yourself reaching for that phone. . .

00:13:08.70,00:13:11.01
. . .go shopping, get your butt[br]in a bubble bath.

00:13:11.22,00:13:14.69
If you want her back,[br]you have got to start acting aloof.

00:13:14.94,00:13:16.86
She has to know you' re not needy.

00:13:17.06,00:13:18.66
So what you have to do is. . .

00:13:18.90,00:13:21.70
. . .you have to accidentally[br]run into her on purpose. . .

00:13:21.90,00:13:23.66
. . .and then act aloof.

00:13:25.26,00:13:27.22
So I' m not gonna lose her?

00:13:27.94,00:13:30.38
Oh, honey, you' re not a total loser.

00:13:33.82,00:13:35.89
I said, "So I' m not gonna lose her?"

00:13:43.46,00:13:44.45
Guess who's here!

00:13:44.70,00:13:47.54
It's the toughest guy in Toyland, Ben!

00:13:47.78,00:13:51.54
Real American hero[br]I'm G.I. Joe!

00:13:51.78,00:13:54.17
Drop the Barbie. Drop the Barbie.

00:13:54.38,00:13:55.70
G.I. Joe?

00:13:55.94,00:13:57.78
You really think he'll fall for that?

00:13:59.02,00:13:59.98
G.I. Joe?

00:14:00.18,00:14:01.30
Cool! Can I play?

00:14:03.90,00:14:07.45
Look, Ben! It's a toy that protects[br]U.S. oil interests overseas!

00:14:07.70,00:14:08.85
Go, Joe!

00:14:12.26,00:14:14.30
-There you are![br]-No, it's not. Sorry.

00:14:14.54,00:14:17.14
But, Phoebe, wait, wait.[br]Phoebe!

00:14:17.38,00:14:20.26
Oh, Joey! Oh, okay![br]See, I didn't recognize you. . .

00:14:20.50,00:14:21.98
. . .in those pants.

00:14:23.82,00:14:26.13
That Tv movie I went in for,[br]did you hear anything?

00:14:26.38,00:14:27.94
I think I got a shot at it.

00:14:28.18,00:14:30.62
Yes, they called![br]You didn't get it!

00:14:31.02,00:14:34.65
Okay? I mean, you didn't get it.[br]I' m sorry. I' m sorry.

00:14:34.90,00:14:37.21
That's okay. These things happen.

00:14:37.46,00:14:40.18
But they shouldn't happen.[br]You know what?

00:14:40.42,00:14:42.42
You' re in a terrible,[br]terrible business.

00:14:43.62,00:14:47.01
I don't want to be the person[br]who makes you look like that.

00:14:47.22,00:14:49.18
I' m okay. See?

00:14:50.90,00:14:53.18
Now you' re sad and creepy.

00:14:53.70,00:14:55.18
I' m sorry. I quit.

00:14:55.90,00:14:59.53
No, no, you can't quit![br]You' re the best agent I ever had.

00:14:59.82,00:15:03.10
Rejection is part of being an actor.[br]You can't take it personal.

00:15:03.34,00:15:07.74
They said they'd never met an ltalian[br]actor with a worse ltalian accent.

00:15:08.30,00:15:09.78
They actually said that?

00:15:09.98,00:15:13.74
Oh, God, there's that face again.[br]See? I can't do this job!

00:15:13.98,00:15:16.02
This is why[br]you have to do this job!

00:15:16.26,00:15:17.41
Agents always lie.

00:15:17.62,00:15:20.46
Estelle just says stuff like,[br]"They went another way. "

00:15:20.70,00:15:22.42
But this? I can use this.

00:15:22.62,00:15:25.34
I can work on a new accent.

00:15:26.30,00:15:29.30
Yeah, okay. If it[br]helps you, okay. Yeah.

00:15:29.54,00:15:31.82
You'll never get me, Joe!

00:15:45.30,00:15:46.58
No, thank you.

00:15:55.30,00:15:56.98
What are you doing here?

00:15:57.62,00:15:59.26
Just a bit of shopping.

00:15:59.50,00:16:00.73
How have you been?

00:16:02.30,00:16:04.26
Are you being British?

00:16:06.46,00:16:07.69
Not anymore.

00:16:08.82,00:16:11.82
Why are you shopping here?[br]You don't live in this neighborhood.

00:16:12.18,00:16:14.46
Were you here waiting for me?

00:16:18.10,00:16:19.01
I' m just. . .

00:16:19.66,00:16:22.22
. . .picking up some things for a party.

00:16:24.10,00:16:25.14
Barley?

00:16:25.94,00:16:27.90
What kind of party serves barley?

00:16:28.14,00:16:31.10
I' m sorry if my friends aren't[br]as sophisticated as yours.

00:16:32.66,00:16:33.89
Where is this party?

00:16:34.14,00:16:34.94
Here in Chelsea.

00:16:35.46,00:16:36.82
Whose party is it?

00:16:37.02,00:16:38.14
A woman's.

00:16:38.38,00:16:39.26
What woman?

00:16:40.70,00:16:41.77
Chelsea.

00:16:43.74,00:16:46.82
Either you' re seeing somebody[br]behind my back. . .

00:16:47.02,00:16:49.58
. . .which would make you[br]the world's biggest jerk. . .

00:16:49.78,00:16:52.01
. . .or you' re pretending[br]to see somebody. . .

00:16:52.26,00:16:55.54
. . .which makes you so pathetic[br]I could cry right here!

00:16:55.78,00:16:59.22
So which of these two guys[br]do you want to be?

00:17:00.22,00:17:01.90
Can I be that guy?

00:17:04.42,00:17:08.62
Okay, we got some more good[br]rejections. Lots of stuff to work on.

00:17:09.62,00:17:10.61
Okay. Shoot.

00:17:10.86,00:17:13.46
Okay. Oh, the zoo commercial.

00:17:13.70,00:17:14.66
I didn't get it?

00:17:14.90,00:17:18.61
They said that you[br]"weren't believable as a human being. "

00:17:19.70,00:17:21.66
So you can work on that.

00:17:22.70,00:17:23.58
Great.

00:17:24.06,00:17:24.97
What else?

00:17:25.18,00:17:28.62
The off-Broadway-play people said[br]that you were "pretty but dumb. "

00:17:29.22,00:17:31.61
Oh, no wait. I' m sorry.[br]That's "pretty dumb. "

00:17:32.30,00:17:34.42
Look, it's okay, no, no, no.[br]Really.

00:17:34.66,00:17:35.65
Look. . .

00:17:36.02,00:17:38.09
. . .I really appreciate this. . .

00:17:38.90,00:17:41.02
. . .but I' m gonna have to[br]go back to Estelle.

00:17:41.90,00:17:44.74
Don't get me wrong.[br]You' re a better agent than she is. . .

00:17:44.98,00:17:48.53
. . .but at least with her, I don't want[br]to blow my pretty dumb brains out.

00:17:49.78,00:17:51.62
Yeah, no, I understand.

00:17:51.82,00:17:53.30
You do? Thanks. Okay.

00:17:53.62,00:17:54.45
Sorry.

00:17:58.26,00:17:59.33
Wait a minute.

00:17:59.58,00:18:00.78
Wait a minute.

00:18:00.98,00:18:04.22
Did you make all that stuff up[br]to get out of being my agent?

00:18:04.46,00:18:05.78
Oh, he caught me.

00:18:08.06,00:18:09.74
I am so busted!

00:18:10.82,00:18:12.97
That's what I suspected!

00:18:16.38,00:18:18.22
And then I just, you know. . .

00:18:19.02,00:18:22.22
. . .threw the bag of barley at her[br]and ran out of the store.

00:18:22.78,00:18:26.41
My God, Chandler, we said be "aloof,"[br]not "a doof. "

00:18:27.98,00:18:30.74
I've actually ruined this, haven't l?

00:18:32.18,00:18:34.18
Is it time for the good ice cream now?

00:18:34.86,00:18:36.18
Yeah, it is.

00:18:36.78,00:18:39.86
You know what?[br]Everything's gonna be okay.

00:18:46.58,00:18:48.62
Can you hold on for a second?

00:18:50.18,00:18:51.22
What do I do?

00:18:51.42,00:18:53.26
I don't know.[br]This is unprecedented.

00:18:53.50,00:18:55.97
If we did what you did,[br]a man would never call.

00:18:56.86,00:19:00.22
I got it! Pretend you just woke up.[br]That'll throw her off!

00:19:00.42,00:19:02.46
-Be sleepy![br]-Yes! And grumpy!

00:19:02.70,00:19:05.22
What are you--?[br]Stop naming dwarfs!

00:19:10.30,00:19:12.82
I' m so glad that you called.

00:19:13.98,00:19:18.22
I know I've been acting[br]really weird lately. . .

00:19:19.50,00:19:22.42
. . .and it's just because[br]I' m crazy about you. . .

00:19:25.10,00:19:29.06
. . .and I just got stupid and scared. . .

00:19:29.30,00:19:31.02
. . .and stupid a couple more times.

00:19:32.30,00:19:33.21
And I' m sorry.

00:19:34.70,00:19:35.50
Really?

00:19:37.66,00:19:38.70
Really?

00:19:39.74,00:19:41.86
He's so lucky.[br]If Janice were a guy. . .

00:19:42.10,00:19:44.82
. . .she'd be sleeping[br]with somebody else by now.

00:19:46.06,00:19:47.26
I love you too.

00:19:47.78,00:19:49.10
It's so unfair!

00:19:56.90,00:19:58.42
G.I. Joe? G.I. Joe?!

00:19:59.02,00:20:02.86
I don't know what to tell you guys.[br]That's the doll he chose.

00:20:03.26,00:20:05.54
What'd you do, dip it in sugar?

00:20:05.74,00:20:07.94
Look, G.I. Joe's in, Barbie's out.

00:20:08.18,00:20:11.46
And if you guys can't deal with it,[br]that's just your too bad.

00:20:13.34,00:20:17.13
What are you being such a weenie for?[br]So he has a Barbie. Big deal.

00:20:17.38,00:20:19.34
You used to dress up like a woman.

00:20:25.18,00:20:26.06
What?

00:20:27.02,00:20:29.25
The way you used to dress up[br]in Mom's clothes?

00:20:29.66,00:20:31.30
What are you talking about?

00:20:31.50,00:20:34.34
The big hat, the pearls,[br]the little pink handbag?

00:20:34.58,00:20:37.02
Okay. You are totally[br]making this up.

00:20:37.50,00:20:39.26
How can you not remember?

00:20:39.50,00:20:41.22
You made us call you "Bea"?

00:20:47.62,00:20:48.66
Oh, God.

00:20:49.82,00:20:52.70
I've literally never been this happy.

00:20:53.38,00:20:55.42
Wasn't there a little song?

00:20:55.62,00:20:57.62
Oh, please, God,[br]let there be a song.

00:20:58.14,00:21:00.21
There was no song.[br]There was no song.

00:21:00.42,00:21:01.74
I am Bea

00:21:02.22,00:21:03.82
-I drink tea--[br]-That's enough.

00:21:04.06,00:21:05.42
Won't you....

00:21:06.50,00:21:07.78
Won't you....

00:21:08.78,00:21:10.01
Won't you....

00:21:11.58,00:21:13.94
Won't you dance around with me?

00:21:20.46,00:21:22.77
I am Bea

00:21:23.30,00:21:25.37
I drink tea

00:21:25.98,00:21:30.46
Won't you dance around with--?

00:21:40.10,00:21:41.33
Ross?
