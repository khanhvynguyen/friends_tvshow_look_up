00:00:03.01,00:00:06.69
Janice has a question.[br]Who of the six of you. . .

00:00:06.93,00:00:10.53
. . .has slept with[br]who of the six of you?

00:00:11.65,00:00:13.88
Wow, it's like a dirty math problem.

00:00:15.09,00:00:18.21
I'm sorry, the answer there[br]would be none of us.

00:00:18.45,00:00:21.89
Over the years, none of you[br]ever got drunk and stupid?

00:00:22.13,00:00:24.60
Well, that's really[br]a different question.

00:00:25.45,00:00:29.84
I can't believe a group of people[br]who spends this much time together. . .

00:00:30.09,00:00:32.00
. . .has never bumped uglies.

00:00:33.57,00:00:36.45
There was that one time[br]Monica and Rachel got together.

00:00:37.29,00:00:38.28
What?

00:00:38.81,00:00:41.01
Excuse me, there was no "time. "

00:00:41.21,00:00:43.60
Okay, but let's say there was.

00:00:44.01,00:00:45.49
How might that go?

00:00:48.21,00:00:49.72
Well then answer me this:

00:00:49.97,00:00:53.81
Have any of you ever almost. . .?

00:00:56.85,00:01:00.21
-Anybody need more coffee?[br]-Hey, there's a dog out there!

00:01:00.97,00:01:03.04
The One With the Flashback

00:01:04.29,00:01:05.28
Subtitles and Rip by[br].:staz:. (staz@post.cz)

00:01:49.97,00:01:52.41
-That is so unfortunate.[br]-What?

00:01:52.65,00:01:55.17
Cute Naked Guy's[br]starting to put on weight.

00:01:56.77,00:01:58.60
I'll be back in just a minute.

00:01:58.85,00:02:03.00
I'm sorry that I left lipstick marks[br]on the phone.

00:02:03.21,00:02:05.60
You didn't leave lipstick marks[br]on the phone.

00:02:05.85,00:02:08.49
Then it must have been you. Bye.

00:02:09.65,00:02:10.56
Bye-bye.

00:02:12.05,00:02:14.69
-That's why I moved out.[br]-Hey, while we're on that. . .

00:02:14.93,00:02:18.37
. . .when are you gonna tell my sister[br]you don't live here anymore?

00:02:18.89,00:02:20.72
On some level, she already knows.

00:02:20.97,00:02:23.33
She doesn't know you sneak out[br]every night. . .

00:02:23.57,00:02:25.21
. . .and back every morning. . .

00:02:25.41,00:02:28.53
. . .and that you've been[br]at your grandmother's for a week.

00:02:28.77,00:02:31.00
Okay, well, maybe not on those levels.

00:02:36.21,00:02:38.81
I'm never gonna find a roommate.[br]Ever.

00:02:39.01,00:02:39.92
Nobody good?

00:02:40.17,00:02:42.64
There was the guy with the ferrets.

00:02:42.85,00:02:43.68
That's plural.

00:02:45.25,00:02:48.45
The spitter. And the guy[br]who enjoyed my name so much. . .

00:02:48.69,00:02:51.21
. . .he made a noise[br]every time he said it.

00:02:51.41,00:02:54.01
"Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing.[br]Bing! "

00:02:54.37,00:02:57.44
"Great apartment, Chandler Bing.[br]Bing! "

00:02:57.69,00:02:59.52
-How many more tomorrow?[br]-Two.

00:02:59.77,00:03:01.92
This photographer[br]who seemed really dull. . .

00:03:02.17,00:03:04.84
. . .and this actor guy[br]who I'm not sure about.

00:03:05.09,00:03:07.45
When I answered[br]the phone "Chandler Bing" . . .

00:03:07.65,00:03:09.96
. . .he said, "Whoa! Short message! "

00:03:12.89,00:03:15.20
Foot on the floor[br]or come over no more:

00:03:16.45,00:03:19.12
Your dresser is missing,[br]but this she notices.

00:03:19.69,00:03:21.44
-What?[br]-I have to go.

00:03:24.09,00:03:26.45
Carol should be home by now, so. . . .

00:03:26.69,00:03:29.21
-How's it going with you guys?[br]-Better, actually.

00:03:29.41,00:03:32.40
I finally figured out why we're[br]having so much trouble.

00:03:32.61,00:03:35.05
-Oh, really?[br]-Yeah. You know how I have you guys?

00:03:35.29,00:03:38.20
She doesn't have any close[br]friends that are just hers.

00:03:38.41,00:03:42.40
But last week, she met this woman[br]at the gym, "Susan" something.

00:03:42.77,00:03:47.13
And they really hit it off, and[br]I think it's gonna make a difference.

00:03:50.01,00:03:51.21
So, Eric. . .

00:03:51.41,00:03:53.45
. . .what kind of photography do you do?

00:03:53.65,00:03:55.08
Oh, mostly fashion.

00:03:55.33,00:03:58.05
There may be models here sometimes.[br]I hope that's cool.

00:04:00.25,00:04:01.65
Yes, that is cool.

00:04:02.29,00:04:04.65
Because I have models here,[br]you know. . .

00:04:05.89,00:04:07.69
: : :never:

00:04:08.69,00:04:12.73
During the summer I spend most[br]weekends at my sister's beach house. . .

00:04:12.93,00:04:14.68
. . .which you're welcome to use.

00:04:14.93,00:04:18.00
Although I should tell you,[br]she's a porn star.

00:04:20.65,00:04:23.40
Well, I still have[br]one more person to meet.

00:04:23.65,00:04:26.40
But unless it turns out[br]to be your sister. . .

00:04:27.01,00:04:29.16
. . .I think your chances[br]are pretty good.

00:04:29.89,00:04:31.01
All right.

00:04:35.21,00:04:37.01
Bedroom, bathroom, living room.

00:04:37.21,00:04:40.89
This here is the kitchen,[br]and thanks for coming by. Bye-bye.

00:04:41.69,00:04:43.97
Don't you wanna ask me[br]any questions?

00:04:46.29,00:04:47.41
Sure.

00:04:49.29,00:04:50.52
What's up?

00:04:51.65,00:04:53.80
Well, I'm an actor.

00:04:54.29,00:04:55.49
I'm fairly neat.

00:04:56.57,00:04:58.24
I got my own Tv.

00:04:58.45,00:05:02.00
Oh, and don't worry, I'm totally[br]okay with the gay thing.

00:05:04.77,00:05:05.84
What gay thing?

00:05:06.81,00:05:11.65
Just, you know, in general.[br]The whole "people-being-gay" thing.

00:05:12.97,00:05:14.37
Totally cool with that.

00:05:17.97,00:05:20.41
Okay, Jerry.[br]Thanks for stopping by.

00:05:28.29,00:05:29.28
Oh, my God!

00:05:37.69,00:05:38.73
Hey, Mon.

00:05:39.69,00:05:42.81
-Wanna hear something that sucks?[br]-Do I ever!

00:05:44.09,00:05:46.65
-Chris says they're closing the bar.[br]-No way!

00:05:46.89,00:05:49.01
They're turning it into[br]a coffee place.

00:05:49.21,00:05:50.61
Just coffee?

00:05:51.25,00:05:53.81
-Where are we gonna hang out?[br]-You got me.

00:05:54.01,00:05:56.48
-Can I get a beer?[br]-Did you pick a roommate?

00:05:56.69,00:05:58.57
-You bet.[br]-Is it the ltalian guy?

00:05:59.09,00:05:59.89
Yeah, right.

00:06:01.65,00:06:02.45
He's so cute.

00:06:02.69,00:06:05.33
That's what I want.[br]A roommate I can walk around with. . .

00:06:05.57,00:06:07.80
. . .and be referred to[br]as "the funny one. "

00:06:08.37,00:06:10.60
Table's free. Rack them up.[br]Back in a minute.

00:06:10.81,00:06:13.01
Get ready for me to whip your butt.

00:06:13.21,00:06:16.01
Okay, but after that,[br]we're shooting some pool.

00:06:18.69,00:06:21.08
Excuse me? Hello? Hi.

00:06:22.25,00:06:24.45
My friend ordered an onion. . .

00:06:24.69,00:06:26.41
. . .not an olive.

00:06:26.61,00:06:29.41
And I ordered a rum and Diet Coke. . .

00:06:29.61,00:06:31.73
. . .which I don't think this is.

00:06:32.09,00:06:34.08
-I am so sorry.[br]-That's all right.

00:06:35.45,00:06:38.36
How hard is it to get a couple[br]drinks right, huh?

00:06:42.09,00:06:44.00
I would like to propose a toast. . .

00:06:44.69,00:06:47.65
. . .to the woman who, in one year[br]from today, will become. . .

00:06:47.89,00:06:50.88
. . .Mrs. Dr. Barry Barber, D.D.S.

00:06:51.61,00:06:54.41
I think it's time[br]to see the ring again.

00:06:58.29,00:07:03.05
Isn't it exciting? I mean,[br]it's like having a boyfriend for life!

00:07:05.81,00:07:07.93
Yeah. I know.

00:07:08.81,00:07:09.80
What?

00:07:10.05,00:07:11.96
Oh, I don't know.

00:07:12.69,00:07:15.57
Well, maybe it's just the idea. . .

00:07:15.81,00:07:18.25
. . .of Barry for the rest of my life.

00:07:18.45,00:07:19.80
I don't know, I think l. . . .

00:07:20.05,00:07:21.93
I feel like having[br]one last fling. . .

00:07:22.17,00:07:25.00
. . .just to sort of get it[br]out of my system.

00:07:27.17,00:07:29.64
-Rachel, stop![br]-You're so bad!

00:07:29.89,00:07:33.52
I'm serious. I really think[br]I need to just have. . .

00:07:33.77,00:07:35.81
. . .some meaningless sex,[br]you know?

00:07:36.01,00:07:38.65
With the next guy I see.

00:07:44.65,00:07:48.01
Excuse me, I seem to have[br]dropped my ball.

00:07:49.97,00:07:50.96
Yeah, so?

00:07:53.57,00:07:55.80
And now I've picked it up again.

00:07:59.01,00:08:01.65
My God![br]I went to high school with her.

00:08:06.81,00:08:09.20
Look! Hi! What do you think?

00:08:09.45,00:08:10.65
Oh, my God!

00:08:10.89,00:08:13.41
You can't even see[br]where the Titanic hit it.

00:08:14.01,00:08:17.37
Yes, his name is Barry.[br]He's a doctor, thank you very much.

00:08:17.57,00:08:20.04
Just like you always wanted.[br]Congratulations.

00:08:20.29,00:08:23.92
Thank you. So how about you?[br]Are you seeing anybody?

00:08:24.17,00:08:25.49
Not right now.

00:08:25.89,00:08:27.37
Oh, well, that's okay.

00:08:28.73,00:08:29.53
I know.

00:08:34.01,00:08:36.21
So I think I'll get back[br]to my friend.

00:08:36.41,00:08:38.69
Oh, yeah. Sure, sure, sure.

00:08:42.29,00:08:45.28
Can we have lunch[br]the next time I'm in the city?

00:08:45.53,00:08:46.60
That'd be great.

00:08:46.81,00:08:48.21
-Okay.[br]-Thanks.

00:08:50.01,00:08:53.48
Ten bucks says I never see[br]that woman again in my life.

00:08:54.25,00:08:56.53
No, honey, really. It's fine.

00:08:56.77,00:08:57.57
Just. . .

00:08:58.17,00:08:59.24
. . .go with Susan.

00:08:59.49,00:09:00.53
Really, I think--

00:09:01.25,00:09:03.69
I think girls' night out[br]is a great idea.

00:09:05.69,00:09:07.25
Okay. Okay. Bye.

00:09:07.77,00:09:11.00
-What are they doing?[br]-I don't know. Something girly.

00:09:14.69,00:09:15.92
Hey, you're early.

00:09:16.17,00:09:18.00
What are you doing with the lamp?

00:09:18.49,00:09:20.32
Just taking it to get rewired.

00:09:22.09,00:09:26.61
Don't take it where you took the[br]stereo. They've had that over a week.

00:09:34.41,00:09:37.13
Mr. Heckles, no one is making[br]any noise up here.

00:09:37.65,00:09:39.93
You're disturbing my oboe practice.

00:09:40.29,00:09:43.28
-You don't play the oboe.[br]-I could play the oboe.

00:09:44.17,00:09:47.00
Then I'm gonna have to ask you[br]to keep it down.

00:09:52.05,00:09:53.04
Who are you?

00:09:53.49,00:09:56.88
-I'm Eric, Chandler's new roommate.[br]-I'm Chandler's new roommate.

00:09:58.85,00:10:01.57
-I don't think so.[br]-I could be Chandler's new roommate.

00:10:02.29,00:10:05.04
-But he told me over the phone--[br]-He told me in person.

00:10:06.45,00:10:07.25
That's weird.

00:10:07.49,00:10:10.56
I'm going to go into[br]my new apartment now.

00:10:29.81,00:10:31.01
Hi again.

00:10:38.77,00:10:40.05
Thank you so much.

00:10:40.29,00:10:43.49
Don't thank me.[br]Thank the jerk that never showed up.

00:10:43.69,00:10:45.84
Okay, I gotta get to work.

00:10:46.89,00:10:49.25
-You want some help?[br]-No, thanks. I got it.

00:10:49.45,00:10:50.33
No, I don't!

00:10:51.85,00:10:53.00
You okay?

00:10:55.17,00:10:57.61
I stood up too fast.[br]Got a little head rush.

00:10:58.49,00:10:59.84
It's the heat.

00:11:03.05,00:11:04.64
And the humidity.

00:11:07.01,00:11:08.24
That's. . .

00:11:08.49,00:11:10.21
. . .a tough combination.

00:11:14.49,00:11:16.64
Do you want to come in[br]for some lemonade?

00:11:17.29,00:11:18.52
Like you wouldn't believe.

00:11:25.69,00:11:27.28
This is a great place.

00:11:28.57,00:11:29.56
Thank you.

00:11:30.49,00:11:32.61
Just make yourself comfortable.

00:11:33.57,00:11:34.69
Gotcha.

00:11:37.29,00:11:40.20
So this place is really[br]my grandmother's.

00:11:43.29,00:11:48.00
I got it when she moved to Florida.[br]Otherwise I could never afford it.

00:11:52.09,00:11:53.81
So if the landlord ever asks. . .

00:11:54.01,00:11:57.61
. . .I'm an 87-year-old woman who's[br]afraid of her vCR. You thirsty?

00:11:57.85,00:11:59.81
You bet I am!

00:12:01.29,00:12:02.09
Okay. . .

00:12:02.33,00:12:03.81
. . .here's your penis!

00:12:09.69,00:12:12.73
Oh, my God![br]What the hell are you doing?

00:12:12.97,00:12:15.61
You said, "You wanna come in[br]for some lemonade?"

00:12:15.81,00:12:17.04
So?

00:12:19.09,00:12:21.00
Were you just gonna give me lemonade?

00:12:22.37,00:12:23.44
Cover yourself up!

00:12:23.89,00:12:25.09
Oh, right. Sorry.

00:12:25.29,00:12:26.80
God, I don't believe this!

00:12:27.01,00:12:30.61
Someone asks you in for lemonade[br]and that means they want to have sex?

00:12:30.81,00:12:33.61
Usually, yeah.[br]Well, not just lemonade.

00:12:33.81,00:12:35.88
Iced tea, sometimes juice.

00:12:37.69,00:12:39.76
Look, sorry. I just--

00:12:40.41,00:12:41.64
I thought you liked me.

00:12:41.89,00:12:43.64
I'm such a jerk.

00:12:45.77,00:12:46.76
It's okay.

00:12:48.09,00:12:50.32
I suppose it could happen to anyone.

00:12:50.57,00:12:52.16
Not anyone I know, but. . . .

00:12:55.09,00:12:57.29
By the way, I can still see it.

00:13:09.89,00:13:10.93
Where's your bed?

00:13:14.01,00:13:16.13
It's not in the apartment?

00:13:21.61,00:13:23.97
I can't believe this[br]is happening again.

00:13:25.09,00:13:28.40
-What?[br]-Okay, enough with the third degree!

00:13:30.21,00:13:32.49
I don't live here anymore.

00:13:33.09,00:13:36.05
-What are you talking about?[br]-I'm sorry.

00:13:36.29,00:13:39.01
I don't live here anymore.

00:13:40.89,00:13:44.80
I didn't know how to tell you.[br]But, you know, everybody else knows.

00:13:47.05,00:13:49.12
Everybody knows?

00:13:49.37,00:13:52.57
That was supposed to be a good thing.[br]I forget why.

00:13:55.89,00:13:58.33
Do you know I couldn't sleep[br]for a month. . .

00:13:58.57,00:14:01.80
. . .because I got a dot of ink[br]on one of the sofa cushions?

00:14:02.37,00:14:04.52
You could've just turned[br]the cushion over.

00:14:04.77,00:14:07.65
I would have, but I had[br]a spaghetti stain on the other side.

00:14:08.09,00:14:08.89
What?

00:14:09.13,00:14:10.93
This is what I'm talking about.

00:14:11.17,00:14:14.40
I need to live in a land[br]where people can spill!

00:14:15.65,00:14:17.21
Well, you can spill.

00:14:17.81,00:14:19.09
In the sink.

00:14:19.97,00:14:23.96
Oh, honey. It's not your fault,[br]you know. This is who you are.

00:14:24.17,00:14:27.00
And I love you.[br]And I want us to be friends.

00:14:27.21,00:14:29.81
And if I stay here,[br]I don't see that happening.

00:14:31.85,00:14:34.16
-I love you too.[br]-Good.

00:14:37.49,00:14:38.37
What?

00:14:40.09,00:14:41.52
What? I'm just sad.

00:14:42.25,00:14:44.81
No, you're not.[br]You're wondering which cushion it is.

00:14:51.05,00:14:53.36
So what are you watching?

00:14:53.77,00:14:54.57
Baywatch.

00:14:56.61,00:14:58.04
What's it about?

00:14:59.69,00:15:01.04
Lifeguards.

00:15:01.81,00:15:04.25
Well, it sounds kind of stup--

00:15:04.81,00:15:05.77
Who's she?

00:15:07.29,00:15:08.36
Nicole Eggert.

00:15:09.01,00:15:10.41
We like her.

00:15:16.25,00:15:17.81
Wow! Look at them run!

00:15:20.09,00:15:21.41
They do that a lot.

00:15:24.41,00:15:25.84
Hey, you want a beer?

00:15:26.09,00:15:28.92
-I'll get one.[br]-Don't get up. I got a cooler here.

00:15:35.09,00:15:37.40
Do you have any beers?[br]We're out of beers.

00:15:37.61,00:15:39.41
Help yourself.

00:15:40.01,00:15:41.29
You okay?

00:15:43.89,00:15:45.17
Phoebe moved out.

00:15:47.69,00:15:48.52
Right.

00:15:49.41,00:15:51.24
I don't understand.

00:15:51.49,00:15:55.80
Am I so hard to live with?[br]ls this why I don't have a boyfriend?

00:15:57.21,00:15:59.93
You don't have a boyfriend because. . . .

00:16:01.29,00:16:04.60
I don't know why[br]you don't have a boyfriend.

00:16:05.37,00:16:07.09
You should have a boyfriend.

00:16:08.17,00:16:09.57
I think so.

00:16:11.77,00:16:12.76
Come here.

00:16:12.97,00:16:13.96
Come here.

00:16:16.49,00:16:19.61
Listen, you are one[br]of my favorite people. . .

00:16:19.81,00:16:23.80
. . .and the most beautiful woman[br]I've ever known in real life.

00:16:40.57,00:16:42.13
Where is everybody?

00:16:42.33,00:16:46.29
It's already closed. Chris gave me[br]the keys to lock up. What is wrong?

00:16:46.53,00:16:49.28
I think my marriage. . .

00:16:49.65,00:16:50.80
. . .is kind of over.

00:16:51.29,00:16:53.01
Oh, no! Why?

00:16:53.21,00:16:55.25
Because Carol's a lesbian.

00:16:59.65,00:17:01.13
And I'm not one.

00:17:04.97,00:17:07.72
And apparently it's not[br]a mix-and-match situation.

00:17:08.41,00:17:09.92
Oh, my God!

00:17:11.25,00:17:12.73
I don't believe it!

00:17:13.77,00:17:15.60
Oh, you poor bunny.

00:17:17.25,00:17:18.45
I'm an idiot.

00:17:19.25,00:17:21.00
I mean, I should have seen it.

00:17:21.21,00:17:26.05
I mean, Carol and I would be out,[br]and she'd see some beautiful woman. . .

00:17:26.29,00:17:29.33
. . .and she'd be "Ross! Look at her! "

00:17:29.57,00:17:30.97
And I'd think. . .

00:17:31.69,00:17:33.76
. . . "God, my wife is cool. "

00:17:40.61,00:17:43.60
Hey, do you think that Susan person[br]is her lover?

00:17:46.45,00:17:48.17
Well, now I do!

00:17:49.97,00:17:51.01
I'm sorry.

00:17:53.49,00:17:55.13
Seven years!

00:17:55.81,00:17:58.80
I mean, we've been together[br]seven years:

00:17:59.45,00:18:02.01
She's the only woman[br]who's ever loved me.

00:18:02.25,00:18:04.72
She's the only woman I've ever. . . .

00:18:11.61,00:18:13.12
This is nice.

00:18:13.37,00:18:14.93
I know. It is, isn't it?

00:18:16.69,00:18:19.57
No, I mean it.[br]This feels really good.

00:18:21.77,00:18:24.00
Is it 1 00%%% cotton?

00:18:28.61,00:18:30.28
And I got it on sale too.

00:18:31.65,00:18:32.45
I should go.

00:18:32.69,00:18:36.73
One of the lifeguards was just about[br]to dismantle a nuclear device.

00:18:37.49,00:18:39.80
If you want to get[br]a drink later, we can.

00:18:40.01,00:18:41.41
That sounds great.

00:18:42.17,00:18:43.97
Oh, and listen, it's gonna be--

00:18:44.37,00:18:45.33
I know.

00:18:46.21,00:18:47.28
Thanks.

00:18:51.49,00:18:55.37
Maybe this wouldn't have happened[br]if I'd been more nurturing. . .

00:18:55.85,00:18:59.16
. . .or I'd paid more attention. . .

00:18:59.49,00:19:01.24
. . .or I had a uterus.

00:19:03.09,00:19:04.81
-I can't believe it.[br]-I know.

00:19:05.05,00:19:08.25
You know, you don't deserve this.[br]You don't, Ross.

00:19:08.49,00:19:10.13
-You're so good.[br]-Thanks.

00:19:10.37,00:19:12.01
And you're so sweet.

00:19:12.21,00:19:14.60
-Thanks.[br]-And you're kind.

00:19:14.81,00:19:16.01
Thanks.

00:19:26.89,00:19:27.85
Come here.

00:19:29.57,00:19:31.08
Wait, wait, wait.

00:19:35.81,00:19:37.01
It's okay.

00:19:43.25,00:19:46.32
Wait, wait, wait![br]My foot is stuck in the pocket.

00:19:47.81,00:19:49.48
-What?[br]-I can't get it out.

00:19:49.73,00:19:52.37
That's not something[br]a girl wants to hear.

00:19:52.69,00:19:54.33
Come on, don't start.

00:19:56.01,00:19:56.81
What?

00:19:57.05,00:19:59.41
Stupid balls are in the way.

00:20:17.29,00:20:18.33
Oh, well.

00:20:19.61,00:20:23.52
That probably wouldn't have been[br]the most constructive solution.

00:20:24.41,00:20:26.21
You have chalk on your face.

00:20:27.57,00:20:31.53
You're right. I don't know why[br]I always thought this was real grass.

00:20:38.41,00:20:39.81
Honey, you okay?

00:20:41.05,00:20:43.01
My wife's a lesbian.

00:20:43.65,00:20:45.21
Cool!

00:20:48.57,00:20:50.72
Ross, Joey. Joey, Ross.

00:21:00.69,00:21:02.73
I can't believe you came back.

00:21:03.65,00:21:05.48
Don't say anything.

00:21:06.05,00:21:09.04
I don't wanna speak.[br]I don't wanna think.

00:21:09.25,00:21:13.85
I just want you to take me and kiss me[br]and make love to me right here. . .

00:21:14.09,00:21:15.32
. . .right now.

00:21:27.49,00:21:29.16
You missed the exit.

00:21:31.01,00:21:31.81
Sorry.

00:21:32.05,00:21:34.80
My God, what were you thinking about?

00:21:37.09,00:21:38.32
Barry.
