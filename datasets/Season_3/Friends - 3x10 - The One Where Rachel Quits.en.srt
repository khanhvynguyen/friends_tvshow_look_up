00:00:04.01,00:00:06.24
-Oh, I don't know.[br]-What?

00:00:06.49,00:00:08.77
Well, as old as he is[br]in dog years. . .

00:00:09.01,00:00:12.32
. . .do you think Snoopy should[br]still be flying this thing?

00:00:12.89,00:00:13.72
Rachel?

00:00:13.93,00:00:14.73
Yeah?

00:00:14.93,00:00:18.64
Remember when you first came here and[br]you got trained by another waitress?

00:00:18.85,00:00:21.45
Sure! Do you need me[br]to train somebody new?

00:00:22.89,00:00:23.85
Good one.

00:00:25.01,00:00:28.77
Actually, Terry wants you[br]to take the training again.

00:00:29.01,00:00:29.92
Whenever.

00:00:33.53,00:00:35.09
Do you believe that?

00:00:40.53,00:00:41.44
Yeah.

00:00:43.65,00:00:45.69
The One Where Rachel Quits

00:01:31.21,00:01:34.33
So that's two boxes[br]of the Holiday Macaroons.

00:01:35.09,00:01:38.05
On behalf of the Brown Birds of America,[br]I salute you.

00:01:40.97,00:01:43.33
Just admit it. You have no backhand.

00:01:43.57,00:01:46.45
Excuse me, little one.[br]I have a very solid backhand.

00:01:46.69,00:01:49.77
Shielding your face[br]and shrieking like a girl. . .

00:01:50.01,00:01:51.69
. . .is not a backhand.

00:01:53.21,00:01:54.77
I was shrieking. . .

00:01:55.01,00:01:56.05
. . .Iike a Marine.

00:01:58.21,00:02:02.49
All right, watch me execute[br]the three P's of championship play.

00:02:02.77,00:02:03.81
Power. . .

00:02:04.53,00:02:05.68
. . .precision. . .

00:02:06.01,00:02:07.05
. . .and panache.

00:02:11.61,00:02:13.37
You broke a little girl's leg?

00:02:14.01,00:02:16.13
I know. I feel horrible, okay?

00:02:16.37,00:02:20.33
It says here that a Muppet got whacked[br]on Sesame Street last night.

00:02:21.33,00:02:23.93
Where exactly were you around 1 0-ish?

00:02:25.69,00:02:28.53
I'm going to see her.[br]I wanna bring her something.

00:02:28.73,00:02:31.17
-What would she like?[br]-A Hello Kitty doll?

00:02:31.41,00:02:33.37
The ability to walk?

00:02:36.97,00:02:38.93
I'm gonna get back to retraining.

00:02:39.13,00:02:41.05
All right. See you, guys.

00:02:41.25,00:02:42.97
Look out, kids! He's coming!

00:02:46.09,00:02:48.05
I gotta go sell Christmas trees.

00:02:48.29,00:02:50.73
Have fun.[br]Oh, wait! No, don't!

00:02:50.93,00:02:53.93
I forgot. I am totally[br]against that now.

00:02:54.97,00:02:56.93
What? Me having a job?

00:02:57.73,00:03:01.97
No, I am against innocent trees[br]being cut down in their prime. . .

00:03:02.21,00:03:04.93
. . .and their corpses[br]grotesquely dressed. . .

00:03:05.13,00:03:07.65
. . .in, like, tinsel and twinkly lights.

00:03:08.29,00:03:10.05
How do you sleep at night?

00:03:10.37,00:03:13.53
Well, I'm pretty tired[br]from lugging the trees around.

00:03:15.93,00:03:20.37
You got this all wrong. Those trees[br]were born to be Christmas trees.

00:03:20.61,00:03:24.57
They're fulfilling their life purpose[br]by making people happy.

00:03:25.05,00:03:25.85
Really?

00:03:28.01,00:03:28.84
Yes!

00:03:30.09,00:03:32.24
Yes, and the trees are happy too. . .

00:03:32.49,00:03:34.56
. . .because for most of them,[br]it's their only. . .

00:03:34.81,00:03:36.33
. . .chance to see New York.

00:03:40.09,00:03:42.37
After you deliver the drinks,[br]take the tray--

00:03:42.61,00:03:45.97
Gunther, please. I have worked here[br]for two and a half years.

00:03:46.21,00:03:48.77
I know the empty trays go over there.

00:03:48.97,00:03:50.89
What if you put them here?

00:03:53.77,00:03:56.97
That's actually a good idea.[br]They'll be closer to the mugs.

00:03:57.21,00:03:59.57
You should have the other[br]waitresses do that too.

00:04:01.01,00:04:02.33
They already do.

00:04:03.41,00:04:05.64
That's why they call it the tray spot.

00:04:06.13,00:04:10.84
I heard them talk about that. I just[br]thought it was a club they went to.

00:04:13.01,00:04:15.32
-I'm sorry.[br]-It's all right.

00:04:16.97,00:04:18.29
Sweetheart.

00:04:21.21,00:04:24.65
So this must be kind of neat[br]for you, huh?

00:04:24.89,00:04:27.12
Your dad tells me[br]you get school off. . .

00:04:27.33,00:04:30.53
. . .and you don't have to sell[br]those cookies anymore.

00:04:32.01,00:04:34.13
I kind of wanted to sell the cookies.

00:04:34.33,00:04:36.97
Whoever sells the most[br]wins a trip to Space Camp. . .

00:04:37.17,00:04:39.17
. . .and gets to sit in a real shuttle.

00:04:39.41,00:04:43.77
You really like[br]all this space stuff, huh?

00:04:44.01,00:04:47.37
My dad says if I'd spend as much[br]time helping him clean apartments. . .

00:04:47.61,00:04:49.92
. . .as I do daydreaming[br]about outer space. . .

00:04:50.17,00:04:52.77
. . .he'd be able to afford a trip[br]to the Taj Mahal.

00:04:53.17,00:04:56.96
You'd have to clean a lot of apartments[br]to go all the way to lndia.

00:04:57.21,00:05:00.21
No. The one in Atlantic City.[br]Dad loves the slots.

00:05:02.41,00:05:05.53
He says he'll double the college[br]money Grandma left me.

00:05:08.13,00:05:10.33
Well, good luck to Dad.

00:05:12.37,00:05:16.73
Say, how many more boxes would you[br]have to sell in order to win?

00:05:16.93,00:05:21.01
The girl who won last year sold 475.

00:05:21.25,00:05:23.97
So far, I've sold 75.

00:05:26.61,00:05:27.97
Four hundred, huh?

00:05:29.09,00:05:32.33
Well, that sounds doable.[br]How much are the boxes?

00:05:32.53,00:05:33.60
Five dollars a box.

00:05:34.33,00:05:36.40
And what is second prize?

00:05:37.33,00:05:41.09
A 1 0-speed bike. But I'd rather have[br]something my dad couldn't sell.

00:05:43.77,00:05:45.13
Well, that makes sense.

00:05:45.61,00:05:47.76
Could you do me one favor?

00:05:48.01,00:05:49.53
Yeah, Sarah. Anything.

00:05:49.77,00:05:51.57
Could you pull the curtains open?

00:05:51.81,00:05:54.45
The shuttle astronauts[br]are gonna be on the news.

00:05:54.69,00:05:56.92
We don't have a Tv,[br]so the lady across the alley. . .

00:05:57.13,00:06:00.33
. . .said she'd push hers up[br]to her window so I can watch it.

00:06:12.49,00:06:13.56
Yes?

00:06:13.81,00:06:16.33
Hi. I'm selling[br]Brown Bird cookies.

00:06:16.57,00:06:21.05
You're no Brown Bird.[br]I can see you through my peephole.

00:06:22.21,00:06:25.33
Hi. I'm an honorary Brown Bird.

00:06:29.21,00:06:30.36
What does that mean?

00:06:30.61,00:06:35.45
It means that I can sell cookies,[br]but I'm not invited to sleepovers.

00:06:39.33,00:06:41.85
I can dial 91 1 at the press[br]of a button, you know.

00:06:42.09,00:06:43.32
Now, go away!

00:06:43.53,00:06:46.25
Please, please.[br]It's for a poor little girl. . .

00:06:46.49,00:06:49.77
. . .who wants to go to Space Camp[br]more than anything in the world.

00:06:50.01,00:06:51.33
I'm pressing.

00:06:51.53,00:06:53.41
A policeman is on his way.

00:06:53.65,00:06:56.21
Okay, okay![br]I'm going, I'm going.

00:07:01.21,00:07:02.53
I can still see you!

00:07:02.73,00:07:03.80
All right!

00:07:09.89,00:07:13.57
-What are you doing here?[br]-I thought a lot about what you said. . .

00:07:13.81,00:07:17.25
. . .and I realize maybe[br]I was a little judgmental.

00:07:17.49,00:07:19.33
Yeah. Oh, but, oh.

00:07:19.69,00:07:21.69
Now, now, Phoebe, remember. . .

00:07:22.21,00:07:24.33
. . .they're just fulfilling[br]their Christmas--

00:07:24.53,00:07:25.89
-Destiny. Yes.[br]-Sure.

00:07:29.21,00:07:31.93
That one doesn't look[br]very fulfilled.

00:07:32.21,00:07:35.33
That's one of the old ones.[br]He's just taking it to the back.

00:07:35.53,00:07:37.73
You keep the old ones in the back?

00:07:37.93,00:07:39.57
That is so ageist.

00:07:41.21,00:07:42.85
We're making room for the fresh ones.

00:07:43.41,00:07:45.33
So what happens to the old guys?

00:07:45.89,00:07:47.25
They go into the chipper.

00:07:48.69,00:07:51.53
I have a feeling that's not[br]as happy as it sounds.

00:08:08.13,00:08:10.52
These are shaped like[br]Christmas characters.

00:08:10.73,00:08:13.25
Santa, Rudolph and Baby Jesus.

00:08:15.01,00:08:17.61
I'll take a box of the[br]cream-filled Jesuses.

00:08:19.17,00:08:22.37
One box? I'm trying to send[br]a little girl to Space Camp.

00:08:22.61,00:08:25.33
I'm putting you down for 5 boxes.[br]What about you?

00:08:25.57,00:08:29.09
All right. Do you have any[br]coconut-flavored deities?

00:08:29.93,00:08:33.81
No, but there's coconut in the[br]Hanukkah Menorah-eos.

00:08:34.81,00:08:37.41
I'll put you down for 8 boxes.[br]One for each night.

00:08:38.61,00:08:39.41
Mon?

00:08:39.93,00:08:42.13
I'll take a box of the Mint Treasures.

00:08:42.37,00:08:43.73
One, and that's it.

00:08:43.93,00:08:46.21
I gained weight after[br]I joined the Brown Birds.

00:08:46.41,00:08:50.29
Remember? Dad bought every one[br]of my boxes and I ate them all.

00:08:51.25,00:08:54.05
No, Mon. Dad had to buy[br]every one of your boxes. . .

00:08:54.29,00:08:56.13
. . .because you ate them all.

00:08:58.41,00:09:02.61
But, you know, I'm sure that's[br]not gonna happen this time.

00:09:03.21,00:09:07.57
Why don't I put you down for 3 Mint[br]Treasures and a couple of Rudolphs?

00:09:07.81,00:09:08.85
No.

00:09:11.21,00:09:13.85
Oh, come on, now.[br]You know you want them.

00:09:14.73,00:09:16.57
Don't do this.

00:09:16.81,00:09:20.93
I'll tell you what,[br]I'll give you the first box for free.

00:09:22.41,00:09:23.93
Oh, God! I gotta go!

00:09:24.13,00:09:26.65
Come on! All the cool kids[br]are eating them.

00:09:29.17,00:09:32.17
And later, I'll show you why[br]we don't just trap spiders. . .

00:09:32.41,00:09:34.93
. . .under coffee mugs[br]and leave them there.

00:09:38.21,00:09:42.45
I'm training to be better at a job[br]that I hate. My life officially sucks!

00:09:42.69,00:09:46.32
Wasn't this supposed to be temporary?[br]You wanted to do fashion stuff.

00:09:46.57,00:09:48.77
Yeah, I'm still pursuing that.

00:09:49.33,00:09:51.77
How, exactly, are you pursuing that?

00:09:52.01,00:09:55.72
Other than sending out resumes,[br]like, what? Two years ago?

00:09:56.41,00:09:59.01
Well, I'm also sending out. . .

00:09:59.61,00:10:01.17
. . .good thoughts.

00:10:02.73,00:10:05.37
If you ask me, as long as you[br]got this job. . .

00:10:05.61,00:10:08.13
. . .you got nothing pushing you[br]to get another one.

00:10:08.37,00:10:09.97
You need The Fear.

00:10:10.81,00:10:12.21
-The Fear?[br]-He's right.

00:10:12.45,00:10:16.93
Quit this job, and you'll have motivation[br]to go after a job you really want.

00:10:17.17,00:10:21.61
Why are you still at a job you hate?[br]Why don't you quit and get The Fear?

00:10:22.81,00:10:25.04
Because I'm too afraid.

00:10:26.81,00:10:31.68
I don't know. I'd give anything[br]to work for a designer or a buyer.

00:10:32.57,00:10:34.85
I just don't want to be 30[br]and still work here.

00:10:35.09,00:10:39.37
Yeah, that'd be much worse than[br]being 28 and still working here.

00:10:41.93,00:10:45.93
Remind me to review with you which[br]pot is decaf and which is regular.

00:10:47.37,00:10:49.73
Can't I just look at the handles[br]on them?

00:10:49.93,00:10:51.25
You would think.

00:10:52.21,00:10:56.13
Okay, fine. Gunther, you know what?[br]I am a terrible waitress.

00:10:56.37,00:11:00.05
Do you know why I'm a terrible waitress?[br]Because I don't care.

00:11:00.61,00:11:03.61
I don't care which pot[br]is regular and which pot is decaf.

00:11:03.85,00:11:05.53
I don't care where the tray spot is.

00:11:05.77,00:11:08.61
I just don't care.[br]This is not what I want to do.

00:11:10.01,00:11:12.37
So I don't think I should do it anymore.

00:11:14.09,00:11:16.37
-I'm giving my week's notice.[br]-What?

00:11:16.61,00:11:17.73
Gunther, I quit.

00:11:20.41,00:11:23.13
Does this mean we have to start[br]paying for coffee?

00:11:28.41,00:11:29.69
Okay, 1 2.

00:11:30.53,00:11:31.76
Twenty-two.

00:11:32.41,00:11:33.56
Eighteen.

00:11:38.41,00:11:39.21
What?

00:11:39.41,00:11:41.13
I spelled out "boobies" .

00:11:45.49,00:11:49.04
Put me down for another box[br]of the Mint Treasures, okay?

00:11:49.41,00:11:51.13
Where are the Mint Treasures?

00:11:52.57,00:11:54.49
We're out. I sold them all.

00:11:55.05,00:11:55.93
What?

00:11:56.81,00:11:58.93
Monica, I'm cutting you off.

00:12:04.53,00:12:06.17
Just a couple more boxes.

00:12:08.05,00:12:10.28
It's no big deal, all right? I'm cool.

00:12:12.17,00:12:14.73
You gotta help me[br]with a couple more boxes!

00:12:15.81,00:12:18.17
Look at yourself.[br]You have cookie on your neck.

00:12:18.73,00:12:19.61
Oh, God!

00:12:22.57,00:12:25.45
-So how many you sold so far?[br]-Check this out.

00:12:25.69,00:12:29.73
-Five hundred and seventeen boxes![br]-Oh, my God! How did you do that?

00:12:29.97,00:12:32.04
The other night I was leaving[br]the museum. . .

00:12:32.29,00:12:36.33
. . .just as Laser Floyd was letting out[br]of the planetarium.

00:12:36.73,00:12:39.33
Without even trying, I sold 50 boxes!

00:12:39.57,00:12:43.01
That's when it occurred to me.[br]The key to my success: The munchies.

00:12:44.77,00:12:49.13
So I started hitting the NYU dorms[br]around midnight.

00:12:51.01,00:12:53.53
I am selling cookies by the case.

00:12:54.29,00:12:57.33
They call me "Cookie Dude" !

00:12:59.41,00:13:03.17
Stop what you're doing. I need[br]envelope stuffers, stamp lickers. . . .

00:13:03.41,00:13:06.93
-Who did these resumes for you?[br]-Me. On my computer.

00:13:07.17,00:13:08.93
You sure used a large font.

00:13:09.21,00:13:12.13
Yeah. Well, "Waitress at[br]a Coffeehouse" . . .

00:13:12.33,00:13:15.33
. . .and "Cheer Squad Co-Captain"[br]only took up so much room.

00:13:17.01,00:13:18.29
Hey, that's funny!

00:13:18.53,00:13:20.97
You're funny, Chandler![br]You're a funny guy!

00:13:21.21,00:13:22.97
You know what else is funny?

00:13:23.61,00:13:26.05
Something else I might have said?

00:13:26.89,00:13:30.13
I don't know. Weren't you the guy[br]that told me to quit my job. . .

00:13:30.37,00:13:33.13
. . .when I had absolutely[br]nothing else to do?

00:13:36.65,00:13:38.13
Calm down. It's gonna be okay.

00:13:38.33,00:13:41.57
No, it's not gonna be okay.[br]Tomorrow is my last day. . .

00:13:41.81,00:13:43.69
. . .and I don't have a lead.

00:13:44.17,00:13:46.37
You know what?[br]I'm just gonna call Gunther. . .

00:13:46.61,00:13:48.33
. . .and tell him I'm not quitting.

00:13:48.57,00:13:50.93
You don't want to give in to The Fear.

00:13:51.13,00:13:54.33
You and your stupid Fear![br]I hate your Fear!

00:13:54.57,00:13:56.85
I would like to take[br]you and your Fear--

00:13:57.09,00:13:59.24
Hey! I got great news!

00:13:59.49,00:14:01.72
Run, Joey! Run for your life!

00:14:03.77,00:14:07.21
What? Rach, listen. Have you ever[br]heard of Fortunata Fashions?

00:14:08.45,00:14:11.73
My dad's got a plumbing job there[br]and he heard there's an opening.

00:14:11.97,00:14:13.77
You want him to get you an interview?

00:14:14.01,00:14:17.77
Oh, my God, yes! I would love that![br]That's so sweet, Joey.

00:14:18.17,00:14:19.13
Not a problem.

00:14:19.33,00:14:21.56
And now, for the great news.

00:14:21.81,00:14:23.37
That wasn't the great news?

00:14:23.61,00:14:25.41
Only if you think[br]it's better than this.

00:14:26.09,00:14:27.41
Snow-in-a-Can!

00:14:29.21,00:14:31.33
You want me to decorate the window?

00:14:31.53,00:14:33.37
Give it kind of a Christmas looky?

00:14:33.81,00:14:35.17
Christmas cookie?

00:14:40.57,00:14:42.77
Okay, and this one here's[br]a Douglas fir.

00:14:43.01,00:14:46.25
Now, it's a little more money,[br]but you get a nicer smell.

00:14:47.33,00:14:48.93
Looks good. I'll take it.

00:14:49.17,00:14:51.32
Wait, wait. No, no![br]You don't want that one!

00:14:51.57,00:14:54.45
No, no. You can have[br]this cool brown one.

00:14:56.09,00:14:57.89
It's almost dead.

00:14:58.49,00:15:02.04
That's why you have to buy it,[br]to fulfill its Christmas destiny.

00:15:02.29,00:15:05.53
Otherwise, they'll throw it[br]into the chipper. Tell him.

00:15:06.53,00:15:10.13
Yeah, the trees that don't fulfill[br]their Christmas destiny. . .

00:15:10.33,00:15:12.13
. . .are thrown in the chipper.

00:15:13.37,00:15:16.45
I think I'm gonna look around[br]a little bit more.

00:15:17.21,00:15:21.05
You gotta stop doing this.[br]I'm working on commission here!

00:15:22.69,00:15:24.73
I'm here to pick out[br]my Christmas tree.

00:15:24.93,00:15:27.97
Well, look no further![br]This one's yours!

00:15:30.81,00:15:33.33
Is this the one[br]that I threw out last year?

00:15:34.69,00:15:38.69
Never mind![br]Everybody wants a green one!

00:15:38.89,00:15:42.44
I'm sorry. I didn't mean[br]to get so emotional.

00:15:42.89,00:15:44.69
The holidays are just hard.

00:15:45.01,00:15:48.40
Oh, honey. Is that because[br]your mom died around Christmas?

00:15:48.65,00:15:50.88
I wasn't even thinking about that.

00:16:00.01,00:16:02.93
Hi there.[br]How many did you sell?

00:16:03.13,00:16:07.13
I'm not gonna tell you. You're the[br]bad man who broke Sarah's leg.

00:16:08.93,00:16:11.21
Hey, now. That was an accident, okay?

00:16:11.57,00:16:12.61
You're a big scrud.

00:16:14.73,00:16:16.13
What's a scrud?

00:16:16.33,00:16:18.33
Why don't you look[br]in the mirror, scrud?

00:16:20.49,00:16:23.29
I don't have to.[br]I can just look at you.

00:16:25.09,00:16:26.13
All right, girls. . .

00:16:27.33,00:16:28.65
. . .and man.

00:16:29.97,00:16:32.12
Let's see your final tallies.

00:16:33.17,00:16:34.05
Debbie.

00:16:35.45,00:16:38.65
Three hundred and twenty-one[br]boxes of cookies. very nice.

00:16:39.17,00:16:40.69
Not nice enough.

00:16:41.89,00:16:43.01
Charla.

00:16:43.25,00:16:45.13
Two hundred and seventy-eight.

00:16:45.37,00:16:47.13
Sorry, dear, but still good.

00:16:47.49,00:16:49.29
Good for a scrud.

00:16:52.69,00:16:54.13
Yes, Elizabeth.

00:16:55.09,00:16:57.29
Eight hundred and seventy-one.

00:16:57.49,00:16:58.81
That's crap!

00:17:02.57,00:17:04.13
Sister Brown Bird.

00:17:05.09,00:17:06.24
Good going.

00:17:09.01,00:17:10.65
Who's next?

00:17:15.21,00:17:16.89
-Hi there.[br]-Hi.

00:17:18.29,00:17:20.29
And batting for Sarah. . .

00:17:21.09,00:17:22.57
. . .Ross Geller.

00:17:23.49,00:17:25.72
Eight hundred and seventy-two.

00:17:27.61,00:17:31.69
Although, it looks like you bought[br]an awful lot of cookies yourself.

00:17:32.01,00:17:35.25
That is because my doctor[br]says that I have. . .

00:17:35.49,00:17:37.45
. . .a very serious. . .

00:17:38.53,00:17:39.89
. . .nougat. . .

00:17:41.97,00:17:43.49
. . .deficiency.

00:17:45.29,00:17:47.93
Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.

00:17:49.21,00:17:53.33
I lost. Some little girl loaned[br]her uniform to her 1 9-year-old sister. . .

00:17:53.53,00:17:58.16
. . .who went down to the U. S. S. Nimitz[br]and sold over 2000 boxes.

00:18:00.13,00:18:03.05
-How'd the interview go?[br]-Oh, I blew it.

00:18:03.29,00:18:05.33
I wouldn't have even hired me.

00:18:06.17,00:18:07.16
Come here, sweetie.

00:18:07.41,00:18:08.48
Listen. . .

00:18:08.81,00:18:13.49
. . .you're gonna go on, like,[br]1 000 interviews before you get a job.

00:18:17.49,00:18:20.33
That's not how that was supposed[br]to come out.

00:18:20.57,00:18:22.85
This is just the worst Christmas ever.

00:18:23.09,00:18:26.05
Maybe you should just[br]stay here at the coffeehouse.

00:18:26.29,00:18:30.17
I can't. It's too late. Terry already[br]hired that girl over there.

00:18:30.41,00:18:31.45
Look at her.

00:18:31.69,00:18:34.53
She's even got waitress experience.

00:18:35.01,00:18:36.61
Last night she was. . .

00:18:37.01,00:18:38.85
. . .teaching everybody[br]how to make. . .

00:18:39.09,00:18:40.32
. . .napkins. . .

00:18:40.57,00:18:41.37
. . .into. . . .

00:18:45.17,00:18:46.69
That word was "swans. "

00:18:51.49,00:18:55.93
Well, seeing that drunk Santa wet[br]himself really perked up my Christmas.

00:19:03.85,00:19:05.13
Oh, my God!

00:19:06.01,00:19:07.33
Merry Christmas!

00:19:08.81,00:19:10.96
You saved them![br]You guys!

00:19:11.21,00:19:13.01
Oh, God, you're the best!

00:19:13.25,00:19:16.37
Looks like Night of the[br]Living Dead Christmas Trees.

00:19:20.97,00:19:22.09
Yeah, this is she.

00:19:24.73,00:19:26.69
You're kidding! You're kidding!

00:19:27.37,00:19:29.21
Oh, thank you! I love you!

00:19:29.41,00:19:31.61
Sure, everybody loves a kidder.

00:19:31.93,00:19:33.33
I got the job!

00:19:33.53,00:19:35.76
That's great.

00:19:36.13,00:19:38.89
God bless us, everyone!

00:19:41.37,00:19:45.21
Here we go. I'm serving[br]my last cup of coffee.

00:19:52.37,00:19:53.44
There you go.

00:19:53.69,00:19:54.89
Enjoy.

00:19:58.01,00:20:00.16
-Should I tell her I ordered tea?[br]-No.

00:20:01.89,00:20:03.04
Excuse me, everyone?

00:20:04.33,00:20:06.40
This is my last night working here. . .

00:20:06.65,00:20:09.37
. . .and I just wanted to say. . .

00:20:09.61,00:20:11.76
. . .that I made some good friends here.

00:20:12.01,00:20:14.57
And it's just time to move on.

00:20:18.29,00:20:21.17
And no offense to everybody[br]who still works here. . .

00:20:21.41,00:20:24.72
. . .but you have no idea how good[br]it feels to say. . .

00:20:24.93,00:20:27.32
. . .that as of this moment. . .

00:20:27.53,00:20:32.13
. . .I will never have[br]to make coffee again.

00:20:32.33,00:20:34.97
Now, Mr. Kaplan Sr.[br]Iikes his coffee strong.

00:20:35.21,00:20:38.41
So you want to use two bags[br]instead of one.

00:20:38.65,00:20:41.25
Now, pay attention.[br]This part's tricky.

00:20:41.73,00:20:44.77
See, some people use filters[br]just once. . . .

00:20:53.81,00:20:56.37
I'm sorry you didn't get to go[br]to Space Camp. . .

00:20:56.61,00:21:01.48
. . .and I'm hoping that maybe somehow[br]this may help make up for it. Okay?

00:21:02.09,00:21:03.37
Presenting. . .

00:21:03.61,00:21:07.53
. . .Sarah Tuddle's[br]Private very Special Space Camp!

00:21:11.57,00:21:13.33
You don't have to do this.

00:21:13.53,00:21:15.49
Oh, come on, here we go!

00:21:16.49,00:21:19.53
Stand by for mission countdown!

00:21:20.57,00:21:21.56
Ten.

00:21:21.81,00:21:22.96
Nine.

00:21:23.21,00:21:24.69
Eight.

00:21:26.01,00:21:27.69
Okay, blast off!

00:21:36.89,00:21:38.81
I'm an alien! I'm an alien!

00:21:39.33,00:21:41.01
Oh, no! An asteroid!
