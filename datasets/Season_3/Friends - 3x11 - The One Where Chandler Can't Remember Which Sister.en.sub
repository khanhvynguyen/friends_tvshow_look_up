00:00:03.64,00:00:06.16
Okay, pick a card.[br]Any card.

00:00:06.40,00:00:08.84
All right, now memorize it.

00:00:09.04,00:00:11.24
Show it to everybody.

00:00:11.48,00:00:12.28
Got it?

00:00:12.52,00:00:14.44
All right.[br]Give it back to me.

00:00:19.60,00:00:20.75
Five of hearts.

00:00:21.72,00:00:23.84
Real magic does exist.

00:00:24.32,00:00:25.84
Joey, how do you do it?

00:00:26.08,00:00:27.40
I can't tell you that.

00:00:30.92,00:00:33.44
Somebody's at the door on the ceiling.

00:00:34.12,00:00:36.72
That's our unbelievably loud[br]upstairs neighbor.

00:00:36.92,00:00:39.48
He took up the carpets,[br]and now you can hear everything.

00:00:39.68,00:00:43.07
Why don't you go ask him[br]to just, "Step lightly, please?"

00:00:44.08,00:00:46.96
I have, like five times.[br]But the guy is so charming. . .

00:00:47.20,00:00:50.24
. . .I go up there to yell,[br]then I end up apologizing to him.

00:00:50.44,00:00:52.32
That is silly!

00:00:53.12,00:00:55.08
I'll go up and tell him[br]to keep it down.

00:00:55.40,00:00:57.12
-All right, be my guest.[br]-Good luck.

00:00:57.32,00:00:58.28
All right, all right. . .

00:00:58.52,00:01:01.04
. . .if you wanna know how I did it,[br]I'll show you.

00:01:01.84,00:01:04.92
When you handed me back the card,[br]what you didn't see was. . .

00:01:05.12,00:01:08.48
. . .I looked at it so fast,[br]it was invisible to the naked eye.

00:01:10.36,00:01:11.64
I just did it.

00:01:12.44,00:01:13.56
Just did it again.

00:01:15.04,00:01:18.04
Here, I'll slow it down[br]so you guys can see it. Ready?

00:01:19.88,00:01:21.72
-I got it now![br]-Okay.

00:01:39.52,00:01:40.67
Thank you.

00:02:31.52,00:02:35.44
Anybody got a length of rope about[br]6 feet long, with a noose at the end?

00:02:35.64,00:02:38.64
-Honey, what's the matter?[br]-I just saw Janice.

00:02:38.88,00:02:43.80
She was at Rockefeller Center, skating[br]with her husband. She looked so happy.

00:02:44.00,00:02:47.24
I almost feel bad for whipping[br]that kid's pretzel at them.

00:02:48.80,00:02:51.68
I remember the first time I saw[br]Katherine after we broke up.

00:02:51.88,00:02:54.68
She was walking and talking[br]with her friend, Donna.

00:02:54.92,00:02:56.32
God, it killed me!

00:02:57.08,00:03:00.60
But you ended up having sex[br]with both of them that afternoon.

00:03:02.00,00:03:04.56
Sorry, I just--[br]Any excuse to tell that story.

00:03:06.80,00:03:09.84
There's a party tomorrow.[br]You'll feel better then.

00:03:10.08,00:03:13.44
I'm gonna be okay. You don't[br]have to throw a party for me.

00:03:13.64,00:03:15.44
It's Joey's birthday.

00:03:16.32,00:03:19.04
Then if anybody should have a party,[br]it should be him.

00:03:22.40,00:03:25.24
I cannot believe[br]she's still up there.

00:03:33.68,00:03:36.28
Well, he totally[br]screwed up the punch line.

00:03:36.52,00:03:38.28
You know, it's supposed to be--

00:03:45.60,00:03:47.08
How's that coffee coming, dear?

00:03:47.32,00:03:48.80
Right away, Mr. Kaplan.

00:03:49.00,00:03:51.60
I'm not suppose to drink it.[br]It makes me gassy.

00:03:53.32,00:03:54.44
I know.

00:03:56.04,00:03:59.04
I'll bet you're thinking,[br]"What's an intelligent girl. . .

00:03:59.24,00:04:01.92
. . .who wants to be in fashion[br]doing making coffee?"

00:04:03.08,00:04:04.23
You got me.

00:04:04.96,00:04:07.08
Don't think I haven't noticed[br]your potential.

00:04:07.32,00:04:11.28
I've got a project for you[br]that's a lot more related to fashion.

00:04:11.48,00:04:13.87
-How does that sound?[br]-That sounds great!

00:04:14.12,00:04:17.08
-Come on over here, sweetheart.[br]-Thank you so much.

00:04:17.32,00:04:20.92
I need these hangers separated[br]ASAP.

00:04:23.24,00:04:24.23
You're welcome.

00:04:28.68,00:04:30.99
Oh, God, I hate my job![br]I hate it.

00:04:31.20,00:04:32.68
I know, honey. I'm sorry.

00:04:32.88,00:04:36.16
I want to quit, but then I think I[br]should stick it out.

00:04:36.40,00:04:37.39
Then I think:

00:04:37.72,00:04:40.68
"Why would a person stay[br]in such a demeaning job. . .

00:04:40.92,00:04:45.24
. . .just because it's remotely related[br]to the field they're interested in?

00:04:46.80,00:04:48.36
Gee, I don't know, Rach.

00:04:48.60,00:04:52.28
Order up! Yentl soup, James Beans,[br]and a Howdy, hold the Doody.

00:04:53.12,00:04:54.96
Come on, I'm sorry.[br]I didn't--

00:04:55.20,00:04:56.68
I don't mind paying my dues.

00:04:56.88,00:04:59.00
But how much[br]will I learn about fashion. . .

00:04:59.20,00:05:01.43
. . .by walking Myra,[br]the arthritic seamstress. . .

00:05:01.64,00:05:03.64
. . .to the bathroom?

00:05:05.48,00:05:06.28
Hi.

00:05:06.52,00:05:08.40
Is my misery amusing to you?

00:05:08.88,00:05:10.84
I'm sorry, I was just. . . .

00:05:11.48,00:05:13.48
It's not funny.[br]This is actually my job.

00:05:13.68,00:05:15.08
Believe me, I've been there.

00:05:15.32,00:05:18.84
I had to sort mannequin heads[br]at that Mannequins Plus.

00:05:19.48,00:05:22.84
I'm just gonna go back[br]to talking to my friend here.

00:05:23.08,00:05:25.84
You can go back to enjoying[br]your little hamburger.

00:05:27.32,00:05:29.52
Just one other thing.

00:05:30.68,00:05:32.04
I work at Bloomingdale's.

00:05:32.28,00:05:35.44
I might know of a possible job,[br]if you're interested.

00:05:38.40,00:05:39.60
Do you want my pickle?

00:05:46.48,00:05:47.28
Hey, guys.

00:05:47.52,00:05:48.72
-Hey, Gunther.[br]-Hi.

00:05:48.92,00:05:51.39
You're going on a date[br]with the noisy guy upstairs?

00:05:51.60,00:05:53.64
Well, he's very charming.

00:05:54.08,00:05:55.04
He's too charming!

00:05:55.28,00:05:58.40
But if you go out,[br]it'll be harder for me to hate him.

00:05:58.72,00:06:00.28
You'll just have to try.

00:06:02.44,00:06:04.36
Joey? Where are the Jell-O shots?

00:06:04.60,00:06:07.64
I don't know. Chandler's[br]supposed to be passing them--

00:06:08.32,00:06:09.44
Chandler!

00:06:09.68,00:06:11.04
Hello-dee-lo!

00:06:12.08,00:06:14.04
Well, somebody's feeling better.

00:06:15.24,00:06:17.47
-Stick out your tongue![br]-Take off your shirt!

00:06:21.12,00:06:22.88
-Oh, my![br]-Oh, my God!

00:06:23.08,00:06:25.55
How many did you have?[br]They're pure vodka.

00:06:25.76,00:06:28.44
Yeah, Jell-O.[br]Just like Mom used to make.

00:06:30.16,00:06:32.63
The most unbelievable thing[br]happened today.

00:06:34.52,00:06:36.67
I had lunch at Monica's[br]and met a guy. . .

00:06:36.88,00:06:38.88
. . .who works for a buyer[br]at Bloomingdale's.

00:06:39.12,00:06:42.67
There's an opening there![br]So I gave him my phone number. . .

00:06:42.92,00:06:46.23
. . .and he'll call me this weekend[br]to get me an interview!

00:06:47.84,00:06:51.23
So this guy's helping you[br]for no apparent reason?

00:06:52.80,00:06:55.27
And he's a total stranger?

00:06:55.48,00:06:58.28
Yeah. His name is "Mark" something.

00:06:58.52,00:07:01.83
Sounds like "Mark Something"[br]wants to have some sex!

00:07:02.92,00:07:03.88
What?

00:07:04.76,00:07:08.64
Why else would he swoop[br]in out of nowhere for no reason?

00:07:09.32,00:07:10.39
To be nice?

00:07:10.64,00:07:14.35
Hey, Joey, are men ever nice[br]to strange women for no reason?

00:07:14.60,00:07:16.00
-No, only for sex.[br]-Thank you.

00:07:18.68,00:07:21.99
So did you tell[br]"Mark Something" about me?

00:07:22.80,00:07:24.84
I didn't have to.[br]I was wearing. . .

00:07:25.04,00:07:28.43
. . .my "I Heart Ross" sandwich board[br]and ringing my bell.

00:07:30.28,00:07:33.20
Joey![br]Happy birthday!

00:07:36.96,00:07:39.92
How many of that girl are you seeing?

00:07:42.24,00:07:45.08
How hammered are you?[br]These are Joey's sisters.

00:07:45.32,00:07:46.88
Hi, Joey's sisters!

00:07:48.52,00:07:49.96
What're we drinking over here?

00:07:50.28,00:07:53.24
Well, I have a vodka[br]and cranberry juice.

00:07:53.44,00:07:54.24
No kidding?

00:07:54.48,00:07:58.16
That's the same drink I made myself[br]right after I shot my husband.

00:08:01.48,00:08:03.76
Okay, I don't know how[br]to talk to you.

00:08:05.40,00:08:06.68
What are you doing?

00:08:07.24,00:08:10.63
I'm taking my ex-girlfriend[br]off my speed dialer.

00:08:11.20,00:08:13.16
No, it's a good thing.

00:08:13.40,00:08:16.68
Why must we dial so speedily anyway?[br]Why rush through life?

00:08:16.92,00:08:18.84
Why can't we savor[br]the precious moments?

00:08:19.08,00:08:20.52
You have some huge breasts!

00:08:22.96,00:08:24.64
-Hi.[br]-Hi.

00:08:25.28,00:08:29.24
So I heard about this Mark guy[br]that Rachel met today.

00:08:29.48,00:08:30.47
Isn't it great?

00:08:32.24,00:08:35.04
Yeah, pretty good.[br]He sounds like a nice, good guy.

00:08:35.24,00:08:38.16
Oh, he is.[br]And he is so dreamy!

00:08:38.40,00:08:41.04
I mean, when he left,[br]I actually used the phrase:

00:08:41.28,00:08:43.12
"Hummina, hummina, hummina. "

00:08:45.12,00:08:46.44
That's excellent.

00:08:50.28,00:08:52.64
So he's "just a nice guy. "

00:08:53.24,00:08:56.79
Do you really think this Mark[br]doesn't want anything for helping you?

00:08:57.04,00:08:59.96
Well, I assume I'll[br]have to take showers with him.

00:09:00.20,00:09:01.68
But that's true of any job.

00:09:06.72,00:09:07.63
How you feeling?

00:09:07.88,00:09:09.88
Well, my apartment isn't[br]there anymore. . .

00:09:10.12,00:09:11.84
. . .because I drank it.

00:09:14.32,00:09:17.76
Where'd you go? We lost you[br]after you opened up all the presents.

00:09:18.28,00:09:22.04
I ended up in the storage room,[br]and not alone.

00:09:24.52,00:09:26.83
No "woo-hooing. " No "woo-hooing. "

00:09:28.28,00:09:29.16
Why, what happened?

00:09:32.20,00:09:34.04
I fooled around with Joey's sister.

00:09:35.44,00:09:36.96
That's not the worst part.

00:09:37.32,00:09:38.68
What is the worst part?

00:09:38.88,00:09:40.84
I can't remember which sister.

00:09:42.08,00:09:44.47
You see what men do?[br]Don't tell me men are nice.

00:09:44.80,00:09:46.36
This is men!

00:09:50.08,00:09:51.15
Are you insane?

00:09:51.40,00:09:54.20
Joey will kill you.[br]He'll actually kill you dead.

00:09:54.40,00:09:56.40
You don't think I thought of that?

00:09:57.32,00:10:00.08
-How can you not know which one?[br]-That's unbelievable.

00:10:00.32,00:10:02.12
-Was it Gina?[br]-Which one's Gina?

00:10:02.36,00:10:04.56
The dark, big hair,[br]with airplane earrings.

00:10:04.80,00:10:05.84
That's Dina, not Gina.

00:10:06.52,00:10:09.44
See? You can't tell[br]which is which either!

00:10:11.40,00:10:13.84
We didn't fool around[br]with any of them.

00:10:17.44,00:10:20.44
It's got to be veronica.[br]The girl in the red skirt.

00:10:20.68,00:10:23.44
I definitely stuck my tongue[br]down her throat!

00:10:24.04,00:10:24.84
That was me.

00:10:28.52,00:10:31.36
When I drink, sometimes[br]I get overly friendly. . .

00:10:31.60,00:10:33.24
-. . .and I'm sorry.[br]-That's okay.

00:10:33.44,00:10:35.24
-That's all right.[br]-That's okay.

00:10:39.40,00:10:41.24
Can I talk to you for a second?

00:10:42.72,00:10:44.04
Hey, Joey!

00:10:46.52,00:10:47.43
Come on.

00:10:48.52,00:10:50.04
Why can't we talk in here. . .

00:10:50.24,00:10:51.64
. . .with witnesses?

00:10:52.72,00:10:54.64
I just got off the phone[br]with my sister.

00:10:54.84,00:10:55.64
Which one?

00:10:55.88,00:10:58.11
-Mary Angela.[br]-Mary Angela.

00:10:58.52,00:11:00.40
Now which one is she again?

00:11:00.60,00:11:02.96
Ask Chandler.[br]He fooled around with her.

00:11:03.52,00:11:06.48
She told me you said[br]you could really fall for her.

00:11:06.72,00:11:10.60
Is that true, or are you just getting[br]over Janice by groping my sister?

00:11:13.52,00:11:15.24
It's gotta be the first one.

00:11:16.44,00:11:17.27
Really?

00:11:17.80,00:11:19.32
That's great!

00:11:20.32,00:11:22.84
You and my sister, sitting in a tree!

00:11:24.40,00:11:25.84
Yep, I'm in a tree.

00:11:29.16,00:11:30.76
Did he call? Did Mark call?

00:11:31.00,00:11:33.20
I'm sorry.[br]But the weekend's not over yet.

00:11:36.60,00:11:39.16
Oh, my God! ls that Phoebe?

00:11:39.40,00:11:41.60
Guess they're back from their date.

00:11:43.32,00:11:45.04
Music!

00:11:45.68,00:11:47.64
very nice!

00:11:55.28,00:11:56.32
Oh, my God!

00:11:59.32,00:12:00.60
So how are you?

00:12:01.40,00:12:04.76
-I am good. I finished my book.[br]-What's it about?

00:12:04.96,00:12:07.64
I don't remember.[br]Do you want to take a walk?

00:12:11.28,00:12:12.40
"Dear Mary Angela:

00:12:13.04,00:12:14.56
Hi, how's it going?

00:12:14.76,00:12:17.07
This is the hardest letter[br]I've ever had to write. "

00:12:17.32,00:12:19.36
What the hell's the matter with you?

00:12:19.88,00:12:23.24
How will Joey react to you[br]blowing off his sister with a letter?

00:12:23.44,00:12:26.08
That's where you tell him[br]that I moved to France. . .

00:12:27.12,00:12:28.96
. . .when actually I'll be in Cuba.

00:12:29.68,00:12:32.92
Look, you've got to do this[br]yourself in person.

00:12:33.12,00:12:34.16
You know her name.

00:12:34.40,00:12:36.96
You just go to the house[br]and ask for Mary Angela.

00:12:37.20,00:12:39.43
When whichever one she is[br]comes to the door. . .

00:12:39.64,00:12:42.03
. . .take her for a walk[br]and let her down easy.

00:12:42.68,00:12:45.36
What if she comes to the door[br]and I ask for her?

00:12:46.84,00:12:47.64
Where in Cuba?

00:13:00.96,00:13:02.72
What are you doing here?

00:13:02.92,00:13:04.88
Waiting for my grandma[br]to do my laundry.

00:13:05.12,00:13:06.16
What about you?

00:13:07.00,00:13:09.12
I'm here to see Mary Angela.

00:13:09.88,00:13:12.11
You are so the man! Come on.

00:13:13.68,00:13:15.56
Now look, listen.[br]Listen. . . .

00:13:16.24,00:13:18.84
Be cool, because Grandma[br]doesn't know about you two.

00:13:19.08,00:13:20.64
You don't want to tick her off.

00:13:21.12,00:13:25.04
She was, like, the sixth person[br]to spit on Mussolini's hanging body.

00:13:26.60,00:13:27.75
Where's Mary Angela?

00:13:28.92,00:13:30.64
She's right in there.

00:13:32.84,00:13:34.64
-Hey, Chandler![br]-Hey, Chandler!

00:13:38.72,00:13:40.56
I can't believe Mark didn't call.

00:13:40.80,00:13:42.48
It's Sunday night and he didn't call.

00:13:42.88,00:13:43.87
Bummer.

00:13:45.08,00:13:48.12
Yeah, right. Look at you.[br]You're practically giddy.

00:13:48.32,00:13:50.68
I'm genuinely sorry[br]the Mark thing didn't work out.

00:13:50.92,00:13:54.96
Look, Rach, I want[br]only good things for you.

00:13:55.20,00:13:57.35
Wait a minute.[br]Why don't you just call Mark?

00:13:59.92,00:14:02.07
Who says you have to sit[br]and wait for him?

00:14:02.28,00:14:03.92
You've got to make stuff happen!

00:14:04.12,00:14:06.92
Yeah, but you don't[br]wanna seem too pushy.

00:14:07.72,00:14:10.24
It's not pushy.[br]He gave her his home number.

00:14:10.60,00:14:13.56
He gave you his home number,[br]as in, to his home?

00:14:13.80,00:14:17.48
And you don't mind if I call,[br]because you want good things for me.

00:14:17.72,00:14:21.24
That's right, good things.[br]That is what I said.

00:14:24.44,00:14:27.44
Mark? Hi, it's Rachel Greene.

00:14:30.72,00:14:33.64
Oh, no.[br]Don't you apologize.

00:14:34.32,00:14:35.28
Yeah, I'll hold.

00:14:35.80,00:14:37.28
He left my number at work.

00:14:37.52,00:14:40.56
Then he had to help his niece[br]with her report on the pioneers.

00:14:41.44,00:14:43.64
That is so made up!

00:14:44.88,00:14:46.44
Oh, my God! Tomorrow?

00:14:46.68,00:14:48.28
That's--[br]No, it's perfect.

00:14:48.52,00:14:50.64
Oh, God![br]Thank you so much!

00:14:50.84,00:14:52.28
Great.

00:14:52.68,00:14:53.80
I got the interview!

00:14:54.84,00:14:55.64
There you go!

00:14:55.84,00:14:58.76
He even offered to meet me for lunch[br]and prep me for it.

00:14:59.00,00:14:59.96
That is amazing!

00:15:00.72,00:15:03.84
Well, if I know Mark,[br]and I think I do. . .

00:15:04.84,00:15:06.24
. . .I'd expect nothing less.

00:15:06.48,00:15:07.92
I gotta figure out what to wear.

00:15:08.12,00:15:11.24
High collar and baggy pants say,[br]"I'm a pro! "

00:15:12.08,00:15:13.07
Yeah, right.

00:15:13.32,00:15:15.24
Okay, I'll see you guys later.

00:15:15.68,00:15:17.24
You go get them!

00:15:17.92,00:15:20.84
What did I do to you?[br]Did I hurt you in some way?

00:15:21.48,00:15:22.28
What?

00:15:22.48,00:15:24.63
"Why don't you call him?"

00:15:25.04,00:15:28.35
Thank you very much.[br]Now he's gonna prep her. . .

00:15:28.56,00:15:32.40
. . .as in what you do before[br]you surgically remove the boyfriend!

00:15:32.84,00:15:33.75
Are you crazy?

00:15:33.96,00:15:37.24
Am l? Am I out of my mind?[br]Am I losing my senses?

00:15:39.00,00:15:42.28
This dreamy guy's taking my girlfriend[br]out for a meal!

00:15:42.52,00:15:44.20
This isn't even about you!

00:15:44.40,00:15:46.92
It's about something wonderful[br]happening for Rachel.

00:15:47.36,00:15:50.04
Even if you're right,[br]and he wants to sleep with her. . .

00:15:50.24,00:15:51.84
. . .does that mean he gets to?

00:15:52.24,00:15:54.08
-No, but--[br]-Don't you trust her?

00:15:55.60,00:15:58.04
Then get over yourself![br]Grow up!

00:16:02.08,00:16:03.64
You grow up.

00:16:14.80,00:16:17.32
This tiramisu is excellent.

00:16:18.12,00:16:19.76
Did you make it, Mary Angela?

00:16:19.96,00:16:21.24
No, I did.

00:16:22.44,00:16:24.04
Well, it's yummy.

00:16:25.12,00:16:25.92
So. . . .

00:16:26.28,00:16:28.64
Mary Angela, do you like it?

00:16:28.88,00:16:31.03
Of course.[br]It's her favorite.

00:16:33.20,00:16:34.43
So. . . .

00:16:35.12,00:16:37.76
Mary Angela, what's[br]your second favorite?

00:16:37.96,00:16:39.44
More of Grandma's tiramisu.

00:16:39.68,00:16:41.83
Oh, would you just please. . .

00:16:43.72,00:16:47.43
. . .give me your recipe, because[br]this is great! It's topnotch!

00:16:47.72,00:16:48.79
That dies with me.

00:16:49.00,00:16:50.23
So will l.

00:16:52.32,00:16:54.47
Excuse yourself[br]and go to the bathroom.

00:16:54.72,00:16:57.00
I was just squinting.[br]It doesn't mean anything.

00:16:57.20,00:16:58.43
Just do it!

00:17:04.04,00:17:06.04
Will you excuse me, I have to. . . .

00:17:19.04,00:17:21.04
Finally! I thought we'd[br]never be alone.

00:17:21.28,00:17:22.84
Can I just tell you something?

00:17:23.08,00:17:25.92
I have not stopped thinking about you[br]since the party.

00:17:27.48,00:17:31.08
Look, I may have jumped the gun here.

00:17:33.00,00:17:34.68
I just got out of a relationship.

00:17:34.92,00:17:36.72
And I'm not really in a. . .

00:17:37.08,00:17:38.68
. . .in a commitment kind of place.

00:17:38.88,00:17:39.84
So? Me neither!

00:17:40.08,00:17:43.28
God, Mary Angela was right.[br]You do have the softest lips.

00:17:45.08,00:17:46.52
You're not Mary Angela?

00:17:46.88,00:17:48.68
No! I'm Mary Therese!

00:17:49.28,00:17:50.84
This is so bad.

00:17:51.28,00:17:53.96
If you're not Mary Angela,[br]then who is?

00:17:54.16,00:17:55.23
I am.

00:17:56.80,00:17:58.44
Oh, it's so bad.

00:18:00.24,00:18:02.31
No, Joey! No, Joey!

00:18:03.32,00:18:04.44
What's going on?

00:18:05.84,00:18:07.88
You're it![br]Now run and hide!

00:18:09.12,00:18:11.64
It's no big deal.[br]Chandler was just kissing me. . .

00:18:11.84,00:18:13.68
. . .because he thought[br]I was Mary Angela.

00:18:13.92,00:18:16.76
What? How could you[br]think she was Mary Angela?

00:18:16.96,00:18:19.88
I wasn't sure which one[br]Mary Angela was.

00:18:21.28,00:18:23.28
Look, I'm sorry.[br]I was really drunk. . .

00:18:23.52,00:18:25.75
. . .and you guys[br]all look really similar.

00:18:25.96,00:18:28.60
-I say punch him, Joey![br]-Yeah, punch him!

00:18:28.84,00:18:30.07
We should all calm down. . .

00:18:30.32,00:18:32.63
. . .because your brother's[br]not gonna punch me.

00:18:33.52,00:18:34.64
Are you?

00:18:35.52,00:18:37.08
That's usually what I'd do.

00:18:37.32,00:18:39.63
But I never thought you'd be[br]on the receiving end.

00:18:39.88,00:18:41.40
How could you do this?

00:18:41.60,00:18:43.83
If you wanna punch me, go ahead.[br]I deserve it.

00:18:44.08,00:18:48.24
But I want you to know that I'd never[br]soberly hurt you or your family.

00:18:48.44,00:18:50.16
You're my best friend.

00:18:50.40,00:18:53.04
And I'd never do anything[br]like this, ever again.

00:18:54.92,00:18:55.88
So what?

00:18:56.12,00:18:58.88
-I say punch him![br]-Yeah, punch him!

00:18:59.96,00:19:02.56
No, I'm not gonna punch Chandler.

00:19:03.12,00:19:04.92
-I'll do it.[br]-No, you won't!

00:19:05.44,00:19:09.04
He knows he did a terrible thing,[br]and I believe him. He's sorry.

00:19:09.28,00:19:11.24
But you got one more apology to make.

00:19:11.44,00:19:13.48
You gotta apologize to Mary Angela.

00:19:14.24,00:19:15.84
-Absolutely. You got it.[br]-All right.

00:19:25.76,00:19:27.60
-Cookie, now you can punch him![br]-What?

00:19:36.24,00:19:37.64
What are you doing here?

00:19:37.88,00:19:40.76
You know, this building's[br]on my paper route, so. . . .

00:19:42.72,00:19:43.95
How did it go?

00:19:44.20,00:19:46.67
The woman I interviewed with[br]was pretty tough. . .

00:19:46.92,00:19:48.72
. . .but thank God Mark coached me.

00:19:48.92,00:19:51.56
Once I talked about the Fall line,[br]she got all happy.

00:19:51.76,00:19:54.04
-I'm so proud of you.[br]-Me too!

00:19:55.24,00:19:56.47
Listen, I'm. . . .

00:19:57.60,00:20:00.84
I'm sorry I've been[br]so crazy and jealous and. . . .

00:20:01.92,00:20:04.07
It's just,[br]I like you a lot, so. . . .

00:20:04.32,00:20:05.23
I know.

00:20:07.72,00:20:08.52
-Hi.[br]-Hi, Mark.

00:20:09.04,00:20:12.32
I just talked to Joanna,[br]and she loves you. You got the job.

00:20:13.12,00:20:14.27
I did?

00:20:15.12,00:20:16.32
Oh, my God!

00:20:16.56,00:20:18.92
Congratulations. . . .

00:20:23.84,00:20:25.07
So, Phoebe?

00:20:25.48,00:20:26.39
How was your date?

00:20:26.60,00:20:28.12
Oh, well, you know. . . .

00:20:28.72,00:20:30.64
Yeah, I do know.

00:20:31.28,00:20:32.51
You were eavesdropping?

00:20:32.72,00:20:36.51
Eavesdropping? Pheebs, the ceiling[br]tiles were falling down.

00:20:38.16,00:20:39.64
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:20:39.84,00:20:44.76
But I really like this guy[br]and I think he really likes me.

00:20:49.92,00:20:50.96
Maybe he's just. . .

00:20:51.20,00:20:54.28
. . .jumping on a pogo stick[br]and he really likes it.

00:20:57.84,00:20:59.80
Maybe the pogo stick likes it too.

00:21:01.60,00:21:04.24
All right, that's it.[br]He cannot do this to Phoebe!

00:21:04.44,00:21:07.48
This guy's gonna get[br]the butt-kicking of a lifetime!

00:21:07.72,00:21:09.84
But is he a big guy?

00:21:10.12,00:21:11.27
We'll all go. Come on.

00:21:11.48,00:21:13.04
Thanks, you guys.[br]Thank you!

00:21:13.24,00:21:14.04
Don't worry!

00:21:14.64,00:21:17.60
God![br]I hope they kick his ass!

00:21:17.80,00:21:19.16
Honey, I'm sorry.

00:21:19.36,00:21:20.92
If it's any consolation. . .

00:21:21.12,00:21:23.84
. . .he sounded like[br]he had more fun with you.
