00:00:07.24,00:00:08.20
Six dollars, please.

00:00:08.44,00:00:10.83
Six? I just had it for one night.[br]It's three.

00:00:11.08,00:00:14.52
Eight o'clock's the cutoff.[br]And, oh, it's 8:02.

00:00:16.12,00:00:18.72
You know, in a weird way,[br]you have too much power.

00:00:19.68,00:00:22.20
You have to help me[br]because I only have three.

00:00:22.92,00:00:24.80
I can help with that.

00:00:25.80,00:00:28.84
Oh, my God. Richard?

00:00:32.20,00:00:33.84
Your lip went bald.

00:00:36.00,00:00:37.07
Thanks.

00:00:39.28,00:00:40.68
You look great!

00:00:41.20,00:00:42.00
Right.

00:00:42.20,00:00:43.84
No, you do. You. . . .

00:00:45.80,00:00:46.60
What?

00:00:46.80,00:00:48.87
You got panties stuck to your leg.

00:00:53.00,00:00:56.88
I was just grabbing some things[br]out of the dryer, and static cling.

00:00:57.92,00:01:02.12
Or maybe God knew I'd be running into[br]you and saw an opportunity.

00:01:03.08,00:01:04.20
It's good to see you.

00:01:04.40,00:01:06.24
It's good to see you too.

00:01:10.88,00:01:12.84
The One Where[br]Monica and Rich are Just Friends

00:01:56.80,00:01:58.84
See that guy?[br]He's in "Classics" now. . .

00:01:59.08,00:02:02.36
. . .but as soon as we leave,[br]he's going straight to the porn.

00:02:02.60,00:02:07.12
He'll go to the counter with Citizen[br]Kane, Vertigo and Clockwork Orgy.

00:02:11.36,00:02:12.59
This is nice.

00:02:13.44,00:02:15.28
-I miss this.[br]-Me too.

00:02:16.08,00:02:18.08
You want to get a hamburger[br]or something?

00:02:18.32,00:02:20.28
I don't know if that's a good idea.

00:02:20.48,00:02:22.95
Just friends.[br]I won't grope you. I promise.

00:02:23.92,00:02:25.68
I think it's too soon.

00:02:25.88,00:02:28.32
No, it's not too soon.[br]I had lunch at 1 1 .

00:02:32.20,00:02:33.40
Yeah, baby!

00:02:34.56,00:02:37.08
-What are you making?[br]-Chocolate milk. Want some?

00:02:37.32,00:02:38.72
No, thanks. I'm 29.

00:02:40.28,00:02:41.96
Oh, my God! I gotta go to work!

00:02:42.20,00:02:44.48
What time will you get off tonight?

00:02:44.72,00:02:45.95
It could be really late.

00:02:46.20,00:02:47.43
Not again!

00:02:48.00,00:02:50.96
I know. I'm sorry.[br]I'll make a deal with you, okay?

00:02:51.20,00:02:53.96
Every night that you're asleep[br]before I get home. . .

00:02:54.20,00:02:58.08
. . .I will wake you up in a way[br]that has proved popular in the past.

00:02:58.28,00:03:01.91
Well, if you need to stay late,[br]I want to be supportive of that.

00:03:05.64,00:03:07.95
Look at you.[br]Since when do you rollerblade?

00:03:08.20,00:03:09.96
Since tomorrow.

00:03:10.76,00:03:12.24
I met a cute guy in the park.

00:03:12.48,00:03:15.64
And he jogs and blades and swims[br]and so we made a deal.

00:03:15.88,00:03:18.24
He's gonna teach me how[br]to do jock stuff.

00:03:20.04,00:03:22.72
-And what are you gonna do for him?[br]-I'm gonna let him.

00:03:22.96,00:03:23.87
Cool.

00:03:24.32,00:03:25.44
Good morning.

00:03:26.20,00:03:28.32
Somebody got in late last night.

00:03:28.52,00:03:31.32
Yeah, well, I ran into Richard.

00:03:31.88,00:03:33.00
When did this happen?

00:03:33.84,00:03:35.72
Around 8:02.

00:03:36.60,00:03:40.68
We talked for a while, and then[br]we went out for an innocent burger.

00:03:40.92,00:03:43.31
There's no such thing as[br]an "innocent burger. "

00:03:44.12,00:03:46.16
-Gonna see him again?[br]-Tomorrow night.

00:03:46.36,00:03:48.08
Monica, what are you doing?

00:03:48.32,00:03:50.55
She spent six months[br]getting over him. . .

00:03:50.76,00:03:55.12
. . .and now she's celebrating that[br]by going on a date with him.

00:03:56.08,00:03:58.00
It's not a date, okay?

00:03:58.24,00:04:01.68
I'm teaching him how to make a[br]lasagna for a potluck dinner.

00:04:01.92,00:04:05.80
You might want to make extra, because[br]you'll be hungry after the sex.

00:04:07.92,00:04:09.72
We're not gonna have sex.

00:04:09.96,00:04:14.04
Nothing's changed here. He still[br]doesn't want children, and I still do.

00:04:14.28,00:04:16.12
So we're just gonna be friends.

00:04:16.36,00:04:17.96
Naked friends.

00:04:23.60,00:04:25.88
-Do you have any ice?[br]-Check the freezer.

00:04:26.12,00:04:28.51
If there's none in there,[br]we're probably out.

00:04:28.88,00:04:30.76
Are you just getting home?[br]It's late.

00:04:31.00,00:04:33.15
I know.[br]I had the greatest day, though.

00:04:33.40,00:04:35.87
I went to a meeting[br]with reps from Calvin Klein.

00:04:36.12,00:04:40.60
I liked a line of lingerie, so my boss[br]ordered a ton of it. And you?

00:04:41.08,00:04:45.12
I discovered I'm able to count all my[br]teeth using just my tongue.

00:04:49.40,00:04:52.95
Why do you have a copy of[br]The Shining in your freezer?

00:04:53.28,00:04:56.20
I was reading it last night[br]and I got scared, so. . . .

00:04:58.16,00:05:00.68
But you're safe from it[br]if it's in the freezer?

00:05:00.92,00:05:02.76
Well, safer.

00:05:02.96,00:05:04.76
I never start reading it. . .

00:05:04.96,00:05:07.84
. . .without making sure[br]we got room in the freezer.

00:05:09.00,00:05:10.80
How often do you read it?

00:05:11.00,00:05:13.72
Haven't you ever read a book[br]over and over again?

00:05:14.68,00:05:16.36
I read Little Women more than once.

00:05:16.60,00:05:18.67
It's a classic.[br]What's so great about The Shining?

00:05:18.88,00:05:22.40
The question should be, what is[br]not so great about The Shining?

00:05:24.16,00:05:27.16
And the answer would be,[br]"nothing. " All right?

00:05:27.40,00:05:29.20
This is the scariest book ever.

00:05:29.40,00:05:31.96
I bet it's better than that[br]classic of yours.

00:05:34.32,00:05:36.24
We'll just see about that, okay?

00:05:36.48,00:05:41.35
I will read The Shining,[br]and you will read Little Women.

00:05:42.12,00:05:43.92
All right, you got it.

00:05:44.36,00:05:47.44
Now, Rach, these little women. . . .

00:05:49.00,00:05:50.60
How little are they?

00:05:50.84,00:05:53.60
I mean, are they, like, scary little?

00:05:59.56,00:06:02.32
Chandler, Ross? This is Robert.

00:06:03.40,00:06:05.68
You have lipstick right here.

00:06:06.00,00:06:08.52
That's okay, it's mine.[br]We just kissed.

00:06:09.12,00:06:11.72
Isn't it a bit cold out for shorts?

00:06:11.96,00:06:14.32
Well, I'm from California.

00:06:14.60,00:06:17.84
Right. Sometimes you guys[br]just burst into flame.

00:06:28.00,00:06:32.92
I'm up. I'm up. I've gotten up now.[br]Anybody want anything?

00:06:33.40,00:06:34.76
-I'll have coffee.[br]-Me too.

00:06:35.00,00:06:35.88
Make that three.

00:06:36.12,00:06:38.51
Ross, why don't you come with me?

00:06:43.36,00:06:45.36
What's the matter?[br]What's going on?

00:06:45.60,00:06:47.44
Robert's coming out.

00:06:48.08,00:06:49.76
What do you mean?[br]ls he gay?

00:06:55.68,00:06:57.75
He's coming out of his shorts.

00:07:00.32,00:07:01.72
What?

00:07:02.28,00:07:04.51
The man is showing brain.

00:07:08.60,00:07:10.99
Are you sure? Hold on.

00:07:12.84,00:07:14.84
I'm sorry.[br]That was a coffee and a. . . .

00:07:15.08,00:07:16.56
Coffee. We could write it down.

00:07:16.80,00:07:19.84
No, no. That won't be necessary.

00:07:26.00,00:07:26.80
Well?

00:07:29.36,00:07:30.64
What do we do? What do we do?

00:07:30.88,00:07:35.80
Well, I suppose we just[br]try to not look directly at it.

00:07:37.48,00:07:39.52
Like an eclipse.

00:07:43.36,00:07:46.04
When people compliment my[br]cooking tonight, what do I say?

00:07:46.28,00:07:50.04
You say, "Thank you. "[br]Then you buy me something pretty.

00:07:50.28,00:07:52.75
Come on, we're gonna[br]put our hands in this bowl. . .

00:07:53.00,00:07:55.72
. . .and we're gonna start[br]squishing the tomatoes.

00:07:56.60,00:07:59.72
This feels very weird.

00:08:00.48,00:08:02.68
You touch people's eyeballs[br]and this feels weird?

00:08:02.92,00:08:07.60
Sure, I touch them. But I spent years[br]learning not to squish them.

00:08:13.20,00:08:14.92
That's my hand.

00:08:18.08,00:08:20.92
-Keep squishing.[br]-The tomatoes are squishing.

00:08:23.48,00:08:25.76
You got some on your shirt.

00:08:26.00,00:08:27.12
Hold on a second.

00:08:27.96,00:08:31.88
Just put a little club soda on it.[br]Get to it right away.

00:08:32.12,00:08:33.92
It should do. . .

00:08:35.56,00:08:36.79
. . .the trick.

00:08:45.64,00:08:46.44
What?

00:08:47.96,00:08:49.36
You've got some on your pants.

00:08:52.80,00:08:54.72
I'll just throw them out.

00:09:00.40,00:09:02.32
These little women!

00:09:05.56,00:09:06.55
You're liking it?

00:09:06.80,00:09:10.04
Oh, yeah.[br]Amy just burned Jo's manuscript.

00:09:10.28,00:09:12.40
I don't see how he could forgive her.

00:09:15.36,00:09:18.36
Jo's a girl.[br]It's short for Josephine.

00:09:19.00,00:09:21.52
But Jo's got a crush on Laurie.

00:09:26.68,00:09:28.75
You mean it's like a girl-girl thing?

00:09:29.00,00:09:31.68
That is the one thing missing[br]from The Shining.

00:09:34.52,00:09:36.56
No, actually, Laurie's a boy.

00:09:37.80,00:09:40.88
No wonder Rachel had to read this so[br]many times.

00:09:44.56,00:09:46.63
How'd the basketball go?

00:09:46.88,00:09:51.32
I learned how to shoot a lay-up,[br]a foul shot, and a 23-pointer.

00:09:51.60,00:09:52.92
You mean a 3-pointer?

00:09:53.16,00:09:55.52
I get more because I'm dainty.

00:09:56.92,00:09:59.44
Is there a phone here[br]to check my messages?

00:09:59.68,00:10:03.60
-In back. Do you want a quarter?[br]-I always carry one in my sock.

00:10:15.48,00:10:18.04
What are you doing?[br]Get back on your side--

00:10:18.28,00:10:19.56
Hello!

00:10:24.52,00:10:26.12
I'm Joey. We haven't met.

00:10:26.36,00:10:27.72
Good to meet you. Robert.

00:10:31.68,00:10:32.80
What?

00:10:33.64,00:10:36.80
What? You guys, what is going on?

00:10:37.04,00:10:38.72
Do you not like Robert?

00:10:39.76,00:10:41.08
Why are you laughing?

00:10:41.32,00:10:43.20
Calm down.[br]No reason to get testy.

00:10:48.60,00:10:51.16
-You guys! Come on![br]-We're sorry.

00:10:51.68,00:10:56.60
It just seems that Robert isn't as[br]concealed in the shorts area. . .

00:10:57.12,00:10:58.48
. . .as one may have hoped.

00:10:59.72,00:11:01.32
What do you mean?

00:11:04.84,00:11:08.60
Could you pass me those cookies?

00:11:08.80,00:11:09.60
Sure.

00:11:15.52,00:11:17.48
So how'd the lasagna go over?

00:11:18.08,00:11:21.92
Really? Good. So you owe me three[br]pretty things.

00:11:23.80,00:11:25.72
I've been thinking about you too.

00:11:26.56,00:11:30.11
Well, no. It's hard,[br]this "platonomy" thing.

00:11:31.12,00:11:32.96
It's a word.

00:11:36.20,00:11:39.96
I do think it's better this way.[br]We're being smart.

00:11:40.20,00:11:42.12
Yes, I'm sure.

00:11:44.20,00:11:46.12
You really sure?

00:11:47.48,00:11:49.24
I'll call you back.

00:11:59.16,00:12:01.72
So we can be friends[br]who sleep together.

00:12:02.24,00:12:05.12
Absolutely.[br]This'll just be something we do.

00:12:05.32,00:12:07.92
Like racquetball.

00:12:08.88,00:12:11.11
Sounds smart and healthy to me.

00:12:12.32,00:12:16.24
So just out of curiosity. . .

00:12:16.48,00:12:19.92
. . .do you currently have[br]any other "racquetball" buddies?

00:12:20.88,00:12:22.95
Just your dad.

00:12:24.56,00:12:27.03
Although that's actually racquetball.

00:12:27.28,00:12:30.56
You know, I do have a blind date. . .

00:12:30.80,00:12:33.88
. . .with my sister's neighbor[br]next Tuesday.

00:12:36.52,00:12:38.32
Do you want me to cancel it?

00:12:38.92,00:12:40.24
No!

00:12:43.28,00:12:46.91
Because if you did,[br]that means you'd be canceling for me.

00:12:47.88,00:12:50.40
-And we're just friends.[br]-Exactly.

00:12:54.48,00:12:56.16
Oh, don't sit down.

00:12:56.40,00:12:58.00
-Ready to go?[br]-You bet.

00:12:58.24,00:13:00.31
And first, here's a gift.

00:13:04.64,00:13:06.71
Stretchy pants?!

00:13:07.08,00:13:11.48
The greatest things in the world![br]lf I were you, I'd wear them every day.

00:13:13.24,00:13:15.44
Gee, thank you.[br]Really, that's so nice.

00:13:15.68,00:13:19.92
But, to be honest,[br]I don't think I can wear these.

00:13:20.16,00:13:23.28
They're so tight.[br]I'd feel like I'm on display.

00:13:25.16,00:13:26.36
I'm sorry.

00:13:26.60,00:13:28.72
That's all right. I'll figure. . . .

00:13:33.56,00:13:34.39
How's it going?

00:13:34.64,00:13:35.92
Good.

00:13:36.48,00:13:37.80
How's The Shining?

00:13:38.00,00:13:40.36
Danny just went into Room 21 7.

00:13:40.56,00:13:44.08
The next part's the best![br]That dead lady in the bathtub--

00:13:45.36,00:13:46.64
You're gonna ruin it!

00:13:46.84,00:13:48.84
I'll talk in code.

00:13:49.08,00:13:52.44
Remember when the kid sees[br]those two "blanks" in the hallway?

00:13:53.32,00:13:54.88
Yeah, that's very cool.

00:13:55.60,00:13:59.44
All "blank" and no "blank" makes[br]"blank" a "blank-blank. "

00:14:01.48,00:14:02.92
No, the end!

00:14:03.12,00:14:05.48
Jack almost kills them[br]with the "blank" . . .

00:14:05.68,00:14:08.12
. . .but in the last second,[br]they get away.

00:14:09.00,00:14:11.00
I can't believe you just did that.

00:14:11.24,00:14:13.92
I can't believe she cracked your code.

00:14:18.56,00:14:21.95
Okay. Laurie proposes to Jo[br]and she says no. . .

00:14:22.20,00:14:26.40
. . .even though she's in love with him.[br]Then he ends up marrying Amy.

00:14:29.24,00:14:31.60
Mine was by accident!

00:14:33.00,00:14:36.44
The boiler explodes and destroys the[br]hotel and kills the dad.

00:14:38.52,00:14:39.51
Beth dies.

00:14:48.08,00:14:50.55
Beth dies?

00:14:51.88,00:14:55.56
Is that true?[br]lf I keep reading, is Beth gonna die?

00:14:55.92,00:14:58.96
No, Beth doesn't die.[br]She doesn't die. Does she, Rachel?

00:14:59.76,00:15:01.32
He's asking if you've ruined. . .

00:15:01.52,00:15:04.80
. . .the first book he's ever loved[br]that didn't star Jack Nicholson.

00:15:08.48,00:15:11.32
No. She doesn't die.

00:15:11.56,00:15:13.32
Then why would you say that?

00:15:17.20,00:15:20.72
Because I wanted to hurt you.

00:15:22.56,00:15:25.12
Oh, there they are.[br]I dropped my keys.

00:15:27.80,00:15:29.08
Got them.

00:15:35.84,00:15:37.96
Sorry. I'm sorry.

00:15:38.20,00:15:40.24
You would not believe my day.

00:15:40.60,00:15:44.04
I had to work two shifts.[br]And then to top it off. . .

00:15:44.28,00:15:48.24
. . .I lost one of my fake boobs[br]in a grill fire.

00:15:51.52,00:15:52.96
What are you smiling at?

00:15:53.20,00:15:55.32
I was thinking your day[br]could still pick up.

00:16:03.40,00:16:05.24
I love this "friend" thing!

00:16:11.96,00:16:16.00
Robert's gonna be here any second,[br]so could one of you just tell him?

00:16:16.56,00:16:17.63
Please, right now.

00:16:17.88,00:16:21.64
Every time I see him, it's "Is it[br]on the loose? ls it watching me?"

00:16:23.36,00:16:24.35
We can't tell him.

00:16:24.60,00:16:29.52
You can't go up to a guy you barely[br]know and talk about his "stuff. "

00:16:29.96,00:16:33.72
He's right. Even if it's[br]to say something complimentary.

00:16:38.64,00:16:39.87
You ready for the gym?

00:16:40.08,00:16:42.96
There's a new rock-climbing[br]wall. We can spot each other.

00:16:44.80,00:16:47.11
Yeah, I can spot you from here.

00:16:50.24,00:16:51.15
What?

00:16:53.00,00:16:54.84
Listen, Robert. . . .

00:16:55.28,00:16:56.40
Hey, don't we have to. . .?

00:16:56.64,00:16:58.12
Yeah, we got. . . .

00:17:05.20,00:17:07.72
I think you're really, really great.

00:17:08.28,00:17:10.12
Oh, God. Here we go again.

00:17:10.36,00:17:14.68
Why does this keep happening?[br]ls it something I'm putting out there?

00:17:16.88,00:17:20.32
Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?

00:17:23.36,00:17:25.75
I don't know what to say.

00:17:26.80,00:17:31.56
Hey, buddy? This is a family place.[br]Put the mouse back in the house.

00:17:53.88,00:17:57.51
Really? It's just like[br]everyone else's apartment.

00:17:57.72,00:17:59.84
It's got rooms and walls[br]and ceilings.

00:18:00.08,00:18:03.16
I just wanted to see where you live.[br]Now give me the tour.

00:18:03.36,00:18:05.00
Oh, my God!

00:18:05.24,00:18:07.60
-This is the living room.[br]-That's nice.

00:18:08.76,00:18:11.12
-And this is the kitchen.[br]-That's real pretty.

00:18:11.36,00:18:13.43
Wait a minute.[br]Don't I get to see the bedroom?

00:18:14.40,00:18:17.20
Well, it's pretty much your typical. . .

00:18:18.40,00:18:19.80
. . .bedroom.

00:18:20.80,00:18:24.43
We're still on this side of the door.[br]I didn't get to see it.

00:18:24.68,00:18:29.16
Oh, shoot. Maybe next time.[br]Thanks for a lovely evening.

00:18:46.28,00:18:48.00
So who is she?

00:18:48.32,00:18:51.24
That was the blind date[br]I told you about.

00:18:51.44,00:18:54.40
She called[br]and switched it from Tuesday.

00:18:56.12,00:18:57.92
Did you like her?

00:18:58.12,00:19:02.72
I'm just asking as a friend,[br]because I am totally fine with this.

00:19:05.12,00:19:06.84
Well, you seem fine.

00:19:07.56,00:19:10.52
Okay, you know what?[br]I'm not fine. I'm not.

00:19:10.76,00:19:14.31
I mean, how could I be fine?[br]Hearing you come in with her.

00:19:14.52,00:19:16.91
She wants to see your bedroom.

00:19:24.00,00:19:25.44
You know what?

00:19:27.68,00:19:29.72
What if we're friends. . .

00:19:30.52,00:19:32.36
. . .who don't see other people?

00:19:34.76,00:19:36.12
You mean "exclusive" friends?

00:19:36.96,00:19:38.28
Why not?

00:19:39.16,00:19:42.52
I mean, this has been[br]the most amazing week.

00:19:43.92,00:19:45.60
Would it be so terrible?

00:19:46.48,00:19:50.32
Even if we were friends[br]who lived together?

00:19:52.60,00:19:56.92
Or maybe someday, friends who stood[br]up in front of their other friends. . .

00:19:57.12,00:19:59.76
. . .and vowed to be friends forever.

00:20:06.28,00:20:08.48
You know, we're back where we were.

00:20:10.12,00:20:15.04
Honey, I would love to do all that,[br]but nothing's changed.

00:20:15.40,00:20:18.84
That's not true.[br]You don't have a moustache.

00:20:21.00,00:20:23.39
Okay, one thing's changed.

00:20:23.80,00:20:27.11
But we still want different things,[br]and we know how this is gonna end.

00:20:28.32,00:20:29.72
You know what?

00:20:30.20,00:20:32.92
I gotta walk out of here right now.

00:20:34.20,00:20:37.91
Because getting over you is the[br]hardest thing I have ever had to do.

00:20:39.80,00:20:41.68
I don't think I could do it again.

00:20:42.68,00:20:44.16
I know I couldn't.

00:20:59.40,00:21:01.71
How about one last[br]game of racquetball?

00:21:07.52,00:21:09.52
Watch the thorns!

00:21:16.40,00:21:17.20
What?

00:21:19.48,00:21:21.20
Beth is really, really sick.

00:21:26.40,00:21:30.32
Jo's there, but I don't think[br]there's anything she can do.

00:21:35.24,00:21:37.60
You wanna put the book[br]in the freezer?
