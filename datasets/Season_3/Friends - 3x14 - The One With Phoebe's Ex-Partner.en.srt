00:00:11.19,00:00:14.81
'Cause every time I see your face

00:00:15.39,00:00:18.82
I can 't help but fall from grace

00:00:19.07,00:00:20.50
This girl's good.

00:00:20.71,00:00:24.33
Yeah, a song with rhyming words![br]I never thought of that before.

00:00:26.71,00:00:27.54
I like her.

00:00:27.75,00:00:31.82
Why? Because she can both sing[br]and play guitar at the same time?

00:00:32.83,00:00:35.46
That's all I'm looking for[br]from these people.

00:00:36.31,00:00:38.14
Look at you, all jealous.

00:00:38.39,00:00:41.46
Come on, Pheebs. You two have[br]completely different styles.

00:00:41.71,00:00:44.22
She's more. . . .[br]You know?

00:00:45.83,00:00:47.30
And you're more. . . .

00:00:48.67,00:00:52.10
Say you'll stay beside me

00:00:57.35,00:00:59.94
See? Everybody else is[br]happy she's done.

00:01:02.47,00:01:04.26
Okay, my next song's called:

00:01:04.51,00:01:07.42
"Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say?[br]I Loved When We Were. . .

00:01:07.67,00:01:10.82
. . .Singing Partners and I Shouldn't[br]Have Left You That Way. "

00:01:13.71,00:01:16.58
One of those "Iook for[br]the hidden meaning" songs.

00:01:18.27,00:01:20.30
The One With Phoebe's Ex-Partner

00:02:05.67,00:02:07.02
Hey, Phoebe.

00:02:07.47,00:02:08.26
Hey, Leslie.

00:02:08.71,00:02:10.10
How'd you know I'd be here?

00:02:10.35,00:02:13.06
I saw vlad at the place[br]where they sell the big fish.

00:02:13.27,00:02:14.94
He said you played here a lot, so. . . .

00:02:15.27,00:02:16.74
I have to go to the bathroom.

00:02:16.99,00:02:18.86
If "big-fish place"[br]comes up again. . .

00:02:19.11,00:02:23.02
. . .I'd like to know if that's several[br]big fish or just one big fish.

00:02:24.23,00:02:26.06
So Phoebe says you write jingles.

00:02:26.31,00:02:28.98
Actually, I said she abandoned me[br]to write jingles.

00:02:31.03,00:02:32.54
Anything we might've heard of?

00:02:34.79,00:02:36.82
Home is never far away

00:02:37.03,00:02:41.02
Home is Homestar Stew.

00:02:42.27,00:02:45.06
But I don't do that anymore.[br]I got kind of sick of it.

00:02:45.31,00:02:49.62
And then I couldn't come up with[br]anything good, so they fired me.

00:02:49.87,00:02:50.85
Bummer.

00:02:52.51,00:02:54.86
Well, you know, I was just. . . .

00:02:55.11,00:02:58.34
I was just thinking[br]and just hoping that. . .

00:02:59.27,00:03:01.50
. . .maybe you'd want[br]to get back together?

00:03:02.19,00:03:03.46
No, but, thanks.

00:03:03.67,00:03:05.94
Come on, Phoebe.[br]Would you just think about it?

00:03:08.63,00:03:10.02
No, but, thanks.

00:03:15.79,00:03:17.22
See you, Pheebs.

00:03:21.23,00:03:22.42
That was kind of brutal.

00:03:23.03,00:03:25.22
Let this be a lesson to all of you.

00:03:25.47,00:03:28.66
Once you betray me,[br]I become like the lce Woman.

00:03:28.91,00:03:33.62
I'm just very cold, hard, unyielding.

00:03:33.83,00:03:37.14
You know, nothing can[br]penetrate this icy exterior.

00:03:37.35,00:03:38.62
Can I have a tissue?

00:03:45.31,00:03:46.82
Is someone in there?

00:03:48.43,00:03:50.06
I'm playing a daredevil game. . .

00:03:50.31,00:03:53.58
. . .called "Wait Until the Last Moment[br]Before I Burst and Die. "

00:03:54.11,00:03:55.46
Jeez, man! Did you fall--?

00:03:55.71,00:03:56.62
Hi!

00:03:57.71,00:04:00.54
So did you?[br]Did you fall high?

00:04:01.59,00:04:03.62
Someone was in the ladies' room.[br]I couldn't wait.

00:04:03.87,00:04:05.90
I left the lid up for you, though.

00:04:08.11,00:04:10.06
You know what, Gunther?[br]Go ahead.

00:04:10.31,00:04:12.22
I'm talking to. . . .

00:04:14.03,00:04:15.82
This is where you say your name.

00:04:16.07,00:04:16.86
Ginger.

00:04:17.07,00:04:19.37
Ginger.[br]I'm talking to Ginger, so. . .

00:04:22.83,00:04:24.82
Don't you have to use the bathroom?

00:04:26.51,00:04:28.78
No, I just--[br]I'd rather talk to you.

00:04:29.83,00:04:30.66
Yes, I do.

00:04:31.91,00:04:33.98
Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.

00:04:34.79,00:04:36.62
There's someone in here.

00:04:38.23,00:04:40.18
-Where's Chandler?[br]-He can't make it.

00:04:40.39,00:04:42.95
He said he had to go back[br]to his job and--

00:04:45.71,00:04:46.62
Joey?

00:04:48.67,00:04:49.81
Joey Tribbiani?

00:04:55.67,00:04:57.42
I can see you, okay?

00:04:57.63,00:04:59.62
You're hiding behind the coats.

00:05:10.39,00:05:11.42
Close one.

00:05:17.03,00:05:17.82
Hi.

00:05:18.63,00:05:19.42
Hi, sweetie.

00:05:19.63,00:05:20.42
Hello.

00:05:21.31,00:05:22.22
Hey, Ross.

00:05:25.43,00:05:27.38
-I've got some bad news.[br]-What?

00:05:27.67,00:05:29.82
I can eat,[br]but I have to come back here.

00:05:30.07,00:05:33.02
Come on. You've worked late[br]every night for two weeks.

00:05:33.23,00:05:35.86
-What is it now?[br]-It's my fault. I quit today.

00:05:36.11,00:05:37.94
But work comes first!

00:05:38.39,00:05:41.34
But that's sad about you, though.[br]What happened?

00:05:41.59,00:05:44.94
What happened? Burn out?[br]Burn all out, did you?

00:05:46.83,00:05:48.86
He's leaving for a better job.

00:05:49.11,00:05:52.02
That's great.[br]So I guess this is goodbye then.

00:05:52.27,00:05:53.25
Goodbye.

00:05:55.67,00:05:56.65
Okay, then.

00:05:57.47,00:05:59.62
Well, we're gonna[br]miss you around here.

00:06:00.11,00:06:01.02
Yeah, me too.

00:06:03.99,00:06:06.62
-So see you on Saturday.[br]-Yeah, you bet!

00:06:25.31,00:06:27.74
Now, you know those[br]are a delicacy in lndia.

00:06:29.31,00:06:32.62
That was Leslie calling[br]to see if we can get back together.

00:06:32.87,00:06:36.82
It's like the 20th time today.[br]Yeah, good luck, Leslie.

00:06:38.11,00:06:39.54
She must've hurt you bad.

00:06:39.75,00:06:42.46
Well, yeah.[br]You know, we were best friends. . .

00:06:42.71,00:06:46.22
. . .ever since we were little.[br]Our moms worked on the barge together.

00:06:47.31,00:06:49.98
You two must've been so cute,[br]running around on a barge.

00:06:50.19,00:06:52.22
You never run on a barge!

00:06:56.51,00:06:58.06
Is Chandler around?

00:06:58.31,00:07:00.54
He met some girl at the coffeehouse.

00:07:01.27,00:07:02.25
Ginger something.

00:07:05.91,00:07:10.26
Sure it wasn't something that sounded[br]liked Ginger? Like "Gingeer"?

00:07:11.79,00:07:13.01
No, it was Ginger.

00:07:13.27,00:07:15.26
I remember because[br]when he told me, I said:

00:07:15.51,00:07:17.62
The movie star

00:07:18.71,00:07:19.50
Oh, man!

00:07:19.83,00:07:21.74
That's the girl I was hiding from.

00:07:21.99,00:07:24.50
When she sees he's my roommate,[br]she'll tell him what I did.

00:07:24.71,00:07:25.62
What did you do?

00:07:26.31,00:07:27.94
Oh, no! I can't. . . .

00:07:29.23,00:07:33.22
I can't tell you. It's the[br]most awful thing I've ever done.

00:07:33.43,00:07:34.54
Don't tell us.

00:07:34.75,00:07:38.22
We'll wait till Chandler gets home.[br]It'll be more fun that way.

00:07:40.11,00:07:42.67
It was, like, four years ago.

00:07:42.91,00:07:45.78
Ginger and I had gone out a few times.[br]Then one weekend. . .

00:07:45.99,00:07:47.42
. . .we went to her Dad's cabin. . .

00:07:47.67,00:07:51.42
. . .just me, her and her[br]annoying little dog, Pepper.

00:07:51.67,00:07:54.54
That night I cooked[br]this really romantic dinner--

00:07:54.75,00:07:56.62
You gave her food poisoning!

00:07:57.07,00:07:58.02
I wish.

00:07:59.31,00:08:02.93
After dinner, me, her and Pepper[br]fell asleep in front of the fire.

00:08:03.31,00:08:07.46
I woke up in the middle of the night[br]and saw the fire was dying out. . .

00:08:07.71,00:08:10.14
. . .so I picked up a log[br]and threw it on.

00:08:12.11,00:08:13.82
Or what I thought was a log.

00:08:14.07,00:08:16.50
Oh, my God![br]You threw Pepper on the fire!

00:08:17.43,00:08:18.41
I wish.

00:08:20.71,00:08:24.18
Another thing I probably[br]should've told you about Ginger. . .

00:08:24.39,00:08:26.58
. . .is that she kind of has a. . .

00:08:27.31,00:08:28.34
. . .artificial leg.

00:08:34.23,00:08:35.62
Oh, my God!

00:08:37.39,00:08:40.42
What did you do after[br]you threw her leg on the fire?

00:08:41.31,00:08:42.26
I ran!

00:08:51.23,00:08:53.22
That's the best kiss I've had. . .

00:08:53.43,00:08:55.81
. . .with anybody I met[br]in a men's room.

00:08:56.83,00:08:57.94
Actually, me too.

00:08:59.99,00:09:01.94
Foot all in the puddle!

00:09:02.19,00:09:03.94
Damn! I hate that!

00:09:04.15,00:09:07.06
-You'll have to get out of those shoes.[br]-Don't worry.

00:09:07.35,00:09:09.10
No, really.[br]You're gonna freeze.

00:09:09.31,00:09:10.58
No, I'm not.

00:09:12.91,00:09:15.62
You're not?[br]Have you got a bionic foot?

00:09:16.79,00:09:18.46
Someday. Maybe.

00:09:28.95,00:09:30.06
Funny book?

00:09:31.91,00:09:35.22
I'm just thinking about[br]something funny I heard today.

00:09:36.67,00:09:39.42
Mark saying,[br]"I'll see you Saturday. "

00:09:41.51,00:09:42.73
Yeah, at the lecture.

00:09:42.99,00:09:45.74
I told you last week.[br]You said you didn't mind.

00:09:45.99,00:09:48.70
It's not the lecture I mind.

00:09:49.67,00:09:52.82
Please tell me it's not because[br]I'm going with Mark.

00:09:53.51,00:09:55.22
-Well--[br]-Oh, my God!

00:09:56.15,00:09:59.34
I'm sorry, but if you're not[br]working with him anymore. . .

00:09:59.55,00:10:01.42
. . .why do you still hang out?

00:10:01.67,00:10:03.26
Because he's my friend.

00:10:03.87,00:10:06.86
But do you really need[br]another "friend"?

00:10:09.23,00:10:12.82
If I stop playing with Joey[br]and Chandler, can I play with Mark?

00:10:13.39,00:10:15.90
Is that funny?[br]Am I suppose to be laughing?

00:10:16.11,00:10:19.62
I don't know. You thought[br]"See you Saturday" was funny.

00:10:20.23,00:10:21.45
Mark is in fashion.

00:10:21.71,00:10:24.62
I like having a friend[br]I can share this stuff with.

00:10:24.83,00:10:27.82
You guys would never[br]go to a lecture with me.

00:10:30.11,00:10:31.54
I'd love to go with you.

00:10:31.75,00:10:32.54
Really?

00:10:33.03,00:10:34.62
I have clothes.

00:10:34.87,00:10:36.26
I even pick them out.

00:10:36.51,00:10:39.82
For all you know,[br]I could be a fashion. . .

00:10:40.59,00:10:41.54
: : :monger:

00:10:46.87,00:10:49.22
I would love for you to go with me.

00:10:49.79,00:10:50.66
What?

00:10:51.51,00:10:53.81
What should I wear?[br]Now I'm all nervous.

00:11:03.51,00:11:06.66
You know, they say[br]"A watched pot never beeps. "

00:11:09.63,00:11:11.42
It's been a couple hours. . .

00:11:12.23,00:11:13.82
. . .and she hasn't called.

00:11:14.67,00:11:16.62
Not that I even care. I don't.

00:11:17.43,00:11:19.26
Why don't you just call her?

00:11:19.51,00:11:21.42
You obviously want to.

00:11:21.67,00:11:23.62
You think you know me so well.

00:11:23.91,00:11:25.46
Well, don't you wanna?

00:11:27.83,00:11:29.34
So I do know you.

00:11:29.59,00:11:31.02
That's what I said.

00:11:33.23,00:11:34.02
Well, so?

00:11:34.51,00:11:35.62
I can't.

00:11:36.11,00:11:38.22
I can't. She dumped me.

00:11:38.47,00:11:40.82
I totally trusted her,[br]then one day it was like:

00:11:41.03,00:11:42.98
"Okay, bye, Pheebs. "[br]Gone!

00:11:44.59,00:11:46.66
You know what the saddest part is?

00:11:46.91,00:11:49.21
When we were playing together,[br]that was. . .

00:11:49.47,00:11:52.42
. . .the most fun I've ever had[br]in all my lives.

00:11:54.39,00:11:59.02
My favorite shoes, so good to me[br]I wear them every day

00:11:59.27,00:12:04.02
Down at the heel, holes in the toes[br]Don 't care what people say

00:12:04.27,00:12:06.94
My feet's best friend[br]Pals to the end

00:12:07.19,00:12:09.65
With them, I'm one hot chickie

00:12:09.91,00:12:13.18
Though late one night[br]Not much light

00:12:13.39,00:12:16.82
I stepped in something icky

00:12:19.51,00:12:22.14
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes

00:12:22.39,00:12:24.82
Always make me smile

00:12:25.03,00:12:29.86
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes[br]Next time I'll...

00:12:30.87,00:12:33.54
...avoid the...

00:12:33.79,00:12:35.42
...pile!

00:12:43.91,00:12:48.26
We're beginning to see a lot of[br]layering of sheer fabrics and colors.

00:12:48.51,00:12:51.62
For instance, a sheer navy blouse[br]over a pink. . . .

00:12:51.83,00:12:54.21
I'm really glad we came.

00:12:59.07,00:12:59.98
You're so pretty.

00:13:03.31,00:13:04.62
I love you.

00:13:08.15,00:13:10.86
Smelly cat, smelly cat

00:13:11.11,00:13:13.74
What are they feeding you?

00:13:13.99,00:13:17.10
Smelly cat, smelly cat

00:13:17.35,00:13:19.91
It's not your fault

00:13:22.47,00:13:23.26
That's great!

00:13:24.11,00:13:26.22
You know, you could totally sell this.

00:13:26.43,00:13:30.21
It'd be perfect for, like,[br]a kitty-litter campaign.

00:13:31.03,00:13:32.82
A jingle?

00:13:33.39,00:13:34.94
Why not?[br]You'd make a ton of money.

00:13:35.15,00:13:38.46
If I was in this for the money,[br]I'd be a millionaire by now.

00:13:40.15,00:13:42.42
You gotta get out of[br]that jingle-head.

00:13:43.91,00:13:46.06
You're right.[br]You're right. I'm sorry.

00:13:46.27,00:13:47.06
That's okay.

00:13:47.31,00:13:50.42
I'm gonna play a song now[br]that's really, really sad.

00:13:50.63,00:13:53.42
It's called "Magician Box Mix-Up. "

00:13:58.55,00:14:01.06
Oversized bracelets,[br]oversized earrings. . .

00:14:01.31,00:14:05.18
. . .oversizing of accessories,[br]in general, is very popular now.

00:14:17.23,00:14:19.42
Can I borrow this?[br]My milk's gone bad.

00:14:19.67,00:14:20.62
I hate that.

00:14:20.87,00:14:23.98
I once had a thing of half-and-half.[br]Stole my car.

00:14:26.27,00:14:28.70
So how was your date with Ginger?

00:14:30.03,00:14:30.82
Great.

00:14:31.47,00:14:32.94
It was great. She's. . . .

00:14:33.19,00:14:35.98
She's great. Great looks[br]and personality. Greatness.

00:14:38.07,00:14:40.02
Sounds like she's got the. . .

00:14:40.51,00:14:41.86
. . .whole package.

00:14:43.19,00:14:45.42
Joey told you about the leg, huh?

00:14:47.19,00:14:49.02
Oh, God![br]It freaked me out.

00:14:49.27,00:14:50.82
It shouldn't, but it did.

00:14:51.03,00:14:53.46
I wanna keep seeing her,[br]but it's like:

00:14:53.71,00:14:56.01
"Hey, you know what?[br]Where's your leg?"

00:15:00.47,00:15:04.01
I'm the smallest person in the world,[br]aren't l?

00:15:04.27,00:15:05.10
Morning.

00:15:05.67,00:15:08.42
Actually, he's the smallest person[br]in the world.

00:15:14.11,00:15:16.06
Heard about the leg-burning, huh?

00:15:18.59,00:15:19.73
It came up.

00:15:20.87,00:15:23.22
Listen, I know it's a long shot, but. . .

00:15:24.75,00:15:27.42
. . .by any chance,[br]did she find that funny?

00:15:31.87,00:15:33.46
So I nodded off a little!

00:15:33.71,00:15:36.54
"Nodded off"?[br]Ross, you were snoring!

00:15:36.79,00:15:40.82
My father's boat didn't make[br]that much noise when it hit rocks!

00:15:41.03,00:15:43.33
Come on! Forty-five minutes. . . .

00:15:43.59,00:15:47.54
Forty-five minutes, the man talked[br]about strappy-backed dresses.

00:15:48.71,00:15:53.06
Okay, how about four hours[br]in a freezing museum auditorium. . .

00:15:53.31,00:15:55.46
. . .Iistening to[br]Professor "Pitstains" say:

00:15:55.71,00:15:58.94
"Remember that thing that died[br]a gazillion years ago?

00:15:59.19,00:16:02.34
Well, here's a little bone[br]we didn't know it had! "

00:16:05.63,00:16:09.41
First of all, it's Professor Pitain.

00:16:09.99,00:16:12.42
And second of all,[br]that little bone proved that. . .

00:16:12.63,00:16:15.86
. . .that particular dinosaur had wings[br]but didn't fly.

00:16:16.07,00:16:18.10
Okay, you know what I just heard?

00:16:22.71,00:16:26.86
A hundred million people[br]went to see a movie about what I do.

00:16:27.11,00:16:31.46
I wonder how many people would go see[br]a movie called Jurassic Parka.

00:16:31.71,00:16:33.62
Oh, that is so--

00:16:33.83,00:16:38.22
A bunch of out-of-control jackets[br]take over an island!

00:16:44.27,00:16:46.34
If what I do is so lame. . .

00:16:46.55,00:16:50.02
. . .then why did you insist on coming[br]with me this morning?

00:16:50.27,00:16:53.02
Was it so I just wouldn't[br]go with Mark?

00:16:55.31,00:16:57.42
I wanted to be with you.

00:16:58.19,00:17:00.22
I don't know, I feel like lately. . .

00:17:00.47,00:17:02.34
. . .you're slipping away from me. . .

00:17:02.55,00:17:04.85
. . .with this new job[br]and all these new people.

00:17:05.11,00:17:07.70
And you've got this[br]whole other life going on.

00:17:07.91,00:17:09.82
I know it's dumb. . .

00:17:10.07,00:17:13.98
. . .but I just hate[br]that I'm not a part of it.

00:17:18.27,00:17:19.62
It's not dumb.

00:17:21.27,00:17:24.22
But maybe it's okay[br]that you're not a part of it.

00:17:24.47,00:17:25.61
You know what I mean?

00:17:27.11,00:17:28.17
I mean, it's like. . .

00:17:28.39,00:17:32.42
. . .I like that you're not[br]involved in that part of my life.

00:17:33.19,00:17:34.82
That's a little clearer.

00:17:36.07,00:17:38.66
See, it doesn't mean[br]I don't love you. . .

00:17:38.91,00:17:41.98
. . .because I do.[br]I love you so much.

00:17:42.19,00:17:44.46
But my work--[br]It's for me, you know?

00:17:44.71,00:17:47.06
I'm out there on my own,[br]and I'm doing it.

00:17:47.31,00:17:51.22
And it's scary,[br]but I love it because it's mine.

00:17:52.07,00:17:54.02
But I mean, is that okay?

00:17:54.43,00:17:55.22
Sure.

00:18:05.31,00:18:07.18
You're thinking about my leg.

00:18:09.27,00:18:11.98
Actually, I forgot.[br]What's the deal with that again?

00:18:12.19,00:18:14.86
Look, it's okay if it bothers you.

00:18:15.11,00:18:17.82
I only need to know[br]how much it bothers you. . .

00:18:18.07,00:18:20.22
. . .because I don't like[br]wasting my time.

00:18:21.07,00:18:22.38
Am I wasting my time?

00:18:24.03,00:18:25.62
No, I don't think so.

00:18:26.79,00:18:30.02
It's like anything else.[br]You just have to get used to it.

00:18:42.03,00:18:42.90
What's that?

00:18:44.31,00:18:46.02
That's my "nubbin. "

00:18:50.63,00:18:52.02
What's a nubbin?

00:18:53.23,00:18:57.01
It's kind of a third-nipple[br]kind of thing.

00:18:58.59,00:19:00.06
You have three nipples?

00:19:00.27,00:19:02.22
Well, you know, two regulars. . .

00:19:02.79,00:19:06.06
. . .and one that[br]barely qualifies as a--

00:19:08.79,00:19:09.58
What?

00:19:09.83,00:19:11.34
Nothing. You know, l. . . .

00:19:11.59,00:19:13.62
I just remembered.[br]I have to leave.

00:19:13.87,00:19:17.14
You have to leave? Now? How come?

00:19:17.35,00:19:19.06
Well, it's nubbin.[br]Nothing!

00:19:20.91,00:19:24.14
You know what?[br]I'll see you later.

00:19:32.31,00:19:33.66
I thought you weren't coming.

00:19:34.19,00:19:36.22
-Where were you?[br]-Come here, come here.

00:19:38.07,00:19:39.18
Don't get mad, okay?

00:19:39.39,00:19:42.02
Don't give me a reason to get mad,[br]okay?

00:19:42.67,00:19:46.45
I played Smelly Cat for[br]my old ad agency. They went nuts!

00:19:46.67,00:19:49.86
I told you I didn't want you[br]to try and sell it. . .

00:19:50.11,00:19:53.26
. . .and you just big, fat did it anyway!

00:19:54.87,00:19:58.57
I think, five years ago,[br]I probably would have done anything. . .

00:19:58.79,00:20:00.14
. . .to play with you.

00:20:00.39,00:20:03.62
But I can do it myself.[br]If I can't trust you, then forget it.

00:20:04.11,00:20:05.54
I don't wanna forget it.

00:20:05.75,00:20:07.42
You know what?[br]You have to choose.

00:20:07.63,00:20:10.62
If the most important thing[br]on the planet to you. . .

00:20:10.83,00:20:15.74
. . .is this cat-poopy thing,[br]then you can have Smelly Cat.

00:20:15.99,00:20:17.82
But we won't be partners.

00:20:18.47,00:20:19.86
So what's it gonna be?

00:20:20.07,00:20:23.22
-Smelly cat, smelly cat[br]-Problem odor in the litter box?

00:20:23.43,00:20:26.58
Don 't change your kitty,[br]change your kitty litter.

00:20:27.03,00:20:29.26
It's not your fault

00:20:31.63,00:20:32.58
Sorry, Pheebs.

00:20:34.43,00:20:35.62
You okay?

00:20:37.19,00:20:38.46
I actually am.

00:20:38.67,00:20:42.21
Because, you know, life's gonna[br]hand you all kinds of stuff.

00:20:42.47,00:20:45.34
You learn your little lessons[br]and hopefully you grow.

00:20:46.47,00:20:49.03
-You wanna hear a new song?[br]-We'd love to.

00:20:51.71,00:20:53.38
Jingle bitch screwed me over

00:20:55.47,00:20:57.02
Go to hell, jingle whore

00:20:57.27,00:21:01.10
Go to hell, go to hell, go to hell

00:21:01.71,00:21:03.66
That's all I have so far.

00:21:08.63,00:21:10.02
Well, hello!

00:21:11.11,00:21:12.82
-Where you been?[br]-The doctor.

00:21:13.03,00:21:14.38
Is everything okay?

00:21:14.59,00:21:17.02
Just had me[br]a little nubbin-ectomy.

00:21:20.51,00:21:22.18
Two nipples, no waiting.

00:21:22.39,00:21:25.62
Well! Just like Rachel[br]in high school.

00:21:26.87,00:21:27.85
What?

00:21:28.67,00:21:31.74
Come on, I was kidding![br]It was such an obvious joke.

00:21:31.95,00:21:33.66
That was an obvious joke.

00:21:33.91,00:21:35.82
And I didn't think of it. Why?

00:21:37.07,00:21:39.02
The source of all my powers.

00:21:40.67,00:21:43.02
Oh, dear God, what have I done?
