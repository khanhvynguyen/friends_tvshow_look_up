00:00:05.18,00:00:08.06
How much you give me to eat[br]this whole jar of olives?

00:00:08.42,00:00:11.54
I won't give you anything,[br]but you'll owe me $2.95.

00:00:12.42,00:00:13.25
Done.

00:00:15.22,00:00:17.26
I need an atlas![br]I need an atlas!

00:00:17.46,00:00:19.42
Why? Do you have a report due?

00:00:20.74,00:00:22.70
I have a date[br]with diplomat I met. . .

00:00:22.90,00:00:25.26
. . .while I was giving free massages[br]outside the U.N.

00:00:26.10,00:00:28.25
And I don't know where his country is.

00:00:28.58,00:00:30.86
Let's start with[br]the free massages at the U.N.

00:00:31.10,00:00:34.70
It's my new thing. I figure,[br]"Bodies at peace make peace. "

00:00:36.54,00:00:39.46
You might just get[br]the first Nobel Prize in rubbing.

00:00:40.06,00:00:41.62
So what country is this guy from?

00:00:46.02,00:00:47.22
There's a "g" in there.

00:00:48.86,00:00:49.66
Where's that?

00:00:49.90,00:00:51.26
In your atlas!

00:00:52.06,00:00:53.26
I don't have an atlas.

00:00:53.46,00:00:56.10
But wait, I do have a globe.[br]Hold on.

00:00:56.34,00:00:57.62
So what's this guy like?

00:00:58.70,00:01:00.50
Well, he's very. . .

00:01:00.74,00:01:02.06
. . .dashing, you know?

00:01:02.30,00:01:03.90
And very, very sophisticated.

00:01:04.10,00:01:05.70
And he doesn't speak English. . .

00:01:05.90,00:01:08.10
. . .but his translator says[br]he totally gets me.

00:01:09.74,00:01:10.86
Okay, here you go.

00:01:11.30,00:01:12.66
What is this?

00:01:14.34,00:01:15.66
It's a globe.

00:01:16.90,00:01:18.26
And a pencil sharpener.

00:01:20.38,00:01:22.98
Need anything copied?[br]I'm going to the Xerox place.

00:01:23.18,00:01:24.06
No, thanks.

00:01:24.30,00:01:26.37
Just give me anything[br]I can make two of.

00:01:28.02,00:01:30.09
If you have nothing to copy,[br]why go there?

00:01:30.34,00:01:32.22
Are you just gonna gawk[br]at that girl. . .

00:01:32.42,00:01:34.49
. . .with the bellybutton ring again?

00:01:34.82,00:01:36.02
You wanna come?

00:01:39.94,00:01:41.93

Czech Subtitles and Rip by[br].:staz:. (staz@post.cz)

00:02:28.14,00:02:31.22
Come on, Chloe. Finish with[br]your customer first.

00:02:31.42,00:02:34.14
Come on, Chloe.[br]Come on, Chloe!

00:02:34.62,00:02:35.45
Can I help you?

00:02:37.86,00:02:41.70
We're having second thoughts[br]about our copying needs.

00:02:41.94,00:02:44.46
And we'll need more time[br]to think about it.

00:02:45.50,00:02:48.78
Chloe, switch with me. Some guys[br]have a crush on you.

00:02:50.34,00:02:52.06
Okay, that hurt us.

00:02:52.90,00:02:55.46
Hi, guys. I haven't seen you[br]since this morning.

00:02:56.54,00:02:57.34
Well. . .

00:03:00.06,00:03:01.05
. . .you know.

00:03:02.70,00:03:04.22
What are you doing tomorrow?

00:03:05.30,00:03:06.34
Both of us?

00:03:06.98,00:03:09.10
Maybe. Does that scare you?

00:03:13.90,00:03:16.50
Relax. Isaac's deejaying[br]at The Philly.

00:03:16.74,00:03:18.65
-You should come.[br]-We'll be there.

00:03:18.86,00:03:21.06
Great. I'll see you then.

00:03:21.30,00:03:22.86
All right! Rock on.

00:03:35.34,00:03:40.26
He says that walking with you makes[br]this strange city feel like home.

00:03:41.34,00:03:43.90
Me too. Although this city[br]is my home.

00:03:44.14,00:03:47.26
So that's dumb, what I said.[br]Don't tell him I said that.

00:03:48.06,00:03:49.66
You make something up.

00:03:59.10,00:04:00.46
Nice! Thank you.

00:04:01.74,00:04:03.46
This is me, here.

00:04:12.94,00:04:15.30
Your eyes are very pretty.

00:04:16.34,00:04:18.65
Thank you very much.

00:04:18.90,00:04:19.70
Oh, thank you.

00:04:28.90,00:04:30.54
He would like to kiss you.

00:04:34.46,00:04:36.45
You don't have to do that now.

00:04:37.02,00:04:38.74
No, no, not him![br]No, you don't.

00:04:43.70,00:04:45.26
The moment's over.

00:05:00.06,00:05:01.46
There it is, right there.

00:05:01.66,00:05:03.10
It's small.

00:05:03.94,00:05:06.66
Yeah, but Sergei said[br]it took the Germans six weeks. . .

00:05:06.86,00:05:09.06
. . .to get all the way across it.

00:05:09.74,00:05:10.78
So you had fun?

00:05:11.86,00:05:14.06
Except for, you know,[br]when you're on a date. . .

00:05:14.26,00:05:16.02
. . .and you're getting along great. . .

00:05:16.22,00:05:18.86
. . .but the guy's translator[br]keeps getting in the way?

00:05:23.46,00:05:25.10
Is Rach in her room?

00:05:25.34,00:05:27.65
She's still at work,[br]but she said to call her.

00:05:27.90,00:05:30.90
Is she gonna cancel on me again?[br]How could she do this?

00:05:31.14,00:05:32.66
What about our anniversary?

00:05:32.90,00:05:36.45
This is the extent of my knowledge[br]on the subject.

00:05:36.74,00:05:37.73
"Call Rachel. "

00:05:38.90,00:05:40.13
What's that on the bottom?

00:05:40.34,00:05:44.05
That's my doodle of[br]a ladybug with a top hat.

00:05:44.46,00:05:45.26
She's fancy.

00:05:50.34,00:05:51.54
-Hey, honey.[br]-Oh, hi.

00:05:51.74,00:05:52.94
What's going on?

00:05:53.18,00:05:56.18
Shipping had a disaster.[br]I've gotta get this order in.

00:05:56.42,00:05:59.62
I'm so sorry, but it looks like[br]I'll be here all night.

00:06:00.14,00:06:02.45
What? Well, how about[br]I come up there?

00:06:02.70,00:06:06.33
No, honey, please.[br]I just have too much to deal with.

00:06:06.54,00:06:09.77
Anyway, I'm going out[br]with Sergei again tonight, and. . . .

00:06:09.98,00:06:11.66
Could you be the translator's date. . .

00:06:11.90,00:06:13.66
. . .so that when we want to be alone. . .

00:06:13.90,00:06:15.86
. . .you two can split off?

00:06:17.18,00:06:18.90
You know, he's kind of cute.

00:06:19.10,00:06:20.78
Like, "really kind of cute"?

00:06:21.02,00:06:24.06
Or "kind of cute" Iike your friend[br]Spackle-Back Larry?

00:06:24.30,00:06:25.86
Don't call him that.

00:06:26.10,00:06:28.46
His name is Spackle-Back Harry.

00:06:32.66,00:06:33.98
Maybe we should get going.

00:06:34.22,00:06:35.90
What time did Chloe say[br]to get there?

00:06:36.14,00:06:38.18
-1 0:30.[br]-What time is it now?

00:06:38.82,00:06:40.05
4:30.

00:06:41.06,00:06:42.10
So we'll hang out.

00:06:47.50,00:06:50.50
Remember when she brought up[br]that thing about the three of us?

00:06:50.74,00:06:52.70
Yes, vividly.

00:06:53.54,00:06:56.66
-She was kidding about that, right?[br]-Yeah, I think so.

00:07:01.50,00:07:03.10
Yeah, I think so.

00:07:03.90,00:07:07.66
God, it'd be weird if that situation[br]presented itself tonight.

00:07:08.90,00:07:10.46
Yeah, I mean. . .

00:07:11.30,00:07:13.06
. . .what would we do?

00:07:15.66,00:07:17.26
Dude, I don't know.

00:07:18.74,00:07:19.78
She was kidding.

00:07:20.02,00:07:21.25
She was. . . .

00:07:21.90,00:07:24.50
Just in case, we should have[br]some ground rules.

00:07:24.70,00:07:26.10
Yeah. For sure.

00:07:26.74,00:07:30.34
You probably want the first one to be,[br]"Never open your eyes. "

00:07:31.90,00:07:35.05
Because you don't[br]want to be doing something. . .

00:07:35.26,00:07:37.98
. . .and then look up, right?

00:07:38.22,00:07:41.37
And see something that[br]you don't want to be seeing.

00:07:42.06,00:07:43.05
Good call. Nice.

00:07:43.30,00:07:45.06
Hold it! Hold it!

00:07:46.50,00:07:49.06
What if my eyes are closed, and. . .

00:07:50.30,00:07:52.13
. . .and my hand is out there. . . .

00:07:53.82,00:07:55.97
Okay, eyes open at all times!

00:08:00.02,00:08:02.86
How do we decide where we. . .

00:08:03.82,00:08:04.97
. . .you know, each would. . .

00:08:05.22,00:08:06.26
. . .you know. . .

00:08:07.30,00:08:08.10
. . .be?

00:08:08.30,00:08:11.45
Right. Well, you know,[br]we could flip for it.

00:08:11.70,00:08:14.58
I guess. But like,[br]what's heads and what's tails?

00:08:16.90,00:08:20.26
If you don't know that,[br]I don't want to do this with you.

00:08:23.34,00:08:26.49
No, no. I am looking[br]at a purchase order here. . .

00:08:26.74,00:08:29.10
. . .that shows we[br]ordered the Riviera bikini. . .

00:08:29.34,00:08:32.34
. . .in a variety of sizes and colors--

00:08:33.74,00:08:36.05
What does it matter what I'm wearing?

00:08:36.62,00:08:39.70
Could I speak to your supervisor?[br]Thank you.

00:08:39.94,00:08:41.09
Hi.

00:08:41.34,00:08:42.70
My God![br]What are you doing here?

00:08:42.94,00:08:45.58
Well, you said[br]you couldn't go out, so. . . .

00:08:45.82,00:08:48.90
You brought a picnic![br]What a boyfriend.

00:08:49.10,00:08:52.06
That's it. On Monday, I start[br]wearing makeup.

00:08:53.02,00:08:55.90
Honey, this is very nice,[br]but I've got a crisis.

00:08:56.10,00:08:57.50
But I've got couscous!

00:08:59.02,00:09:01.33
Honey,[br]I know it's our anniversary. . .

00:09:01.54,00:09:04.85
. . .but I told you on the phone,[br]I don't have time to stop.

00:09:05.10,00:09:08.41
You don't have to stop.[br]I'm invisible. I'm not here.

00:09:08.62,00:09:10.18
Yeah, but I don't--

00:09:10.38,00:09:12.69
Who approved that order?

00:09:12.90,00:09:15.90
Well, there is no Mark Robinson[br]in this office.

00:09:16.30,00:09:19.26
-Get Mark on the phone![br]-I love Mark. Do you know him?

00:09:21.06,00:09:23.13
Let me check that[br]with what I've got.

00:09:23.34,00:09:26.70
See, 038 is not the number[br]for this store. 038 is Atlanta.

00:09:31.94,00:09:32.74
Pepper?

00:09:34.82,00:09:35.78
None for me.

00:09:36.02,00:09:37.09
Okay, sorry!

00:09:38.54,00:09:41.46
Sorry. As I was saying,[br]the store number is wrong.

00:09:41.66,00:09:42.86
And I'm sorry, but--

00:09:43.06,00:09:44.18
Oh, my God!

00:09:51.58,00:09:55.02
I have to call you back.[br]I've got Shemp in my office.

00:09:58.14,00:10:00.10
-What are you doing?[br]-I'm sorry.

00:10:00.30,00:10:03.66
But somebody's off the phone![br]How about a glass of wine. . .

00:10:03.90,00:10:06.66
. . .by the fire?[br]I can get it going again. . . .

00:10:07.34,00:10:10.18
You're not listening.[br]I don't have time to stop.

00:10:10.38,00:10:13.14
-You don't have 1 0 minutes?[br]-I don't have 1 0 minutes!

00:10:13.38,00:10:16.85
-Sophie, does she have 1 0 minutes?[br]-I told you, I don't!

00:10:17.10,00:10:20.30
Don't yell. This is[br]the most I've seen you all week.

00:10:20.54,00:10:24.50
Look, I cannot do this right now.[br]I've got a deadline!

00:10:24.74,00:10:26.50
Go home and we'll talk later.

00:10:26.74,00:10:28.50
-Yeah, but wait--![br]-Goodbye!

00:10:35.62,00:10:38.22
Actually, that's our three-hole punch.

00:10:44.94,00:10:45.90
Hi.

00:10:46.50,00:10:48.70
Look, about what happened earlier--

00:10:48.94,00:10:52.33
I completely understand.[br]You were stressed.

00:10:55.66,00:10:58.58
I was gonna give you a chance[br]to apologize to me.

00:10:59.10,00:11:01.66
For letting you throw me[br]out of your office?

00:11:01.90,00:11:04.78
You had no right[br]coming down to my office.

00:11:05.02,00:11:08.46
You do not bring a picnic basket[br]to somebody's work. . .

00:11:08.66,00:11:10.62
. . .unless they're a park ranger!

00:11:13.06,00:11:16.45
Excuse me for wanting to be with[br]my girl on our anniversary.

00:11:16.70,00:11:18.06
Boy, what an ass am l!

00:11:19.42,00:11:22.06
But I told you[br]I didn't have the time!

00:11:22.30,00:11:23.98
Well, you never have the time.

00:11:24.18,00:11:26.49
I don't feel like I have[br]a girlfriend anymore.

00:11:26.70,00:11:28.46
Do you want me to quit my job. . .

00:11:28.70,00:11:31.09
. . .so you can feel like[br]you have a girlfriend?

00:11:31.34,00:11:34.81
It would nice if you'd realize[br]that it's just a job.

00:11:35.34,00:11:37.90
Just a job?

00:11:39.42,00:11:43.10
It's the first time in my life[br]I'm doing something I care about!

00:11:43.34,00:11:46.38
The first time[br]I'm doing something I'm good at!

00:11:46.62,00:11:47.98
If you don't get that--

00:11:48.18,00:11:50.33
I get that, and I'm happy for you.

00:11:50.54,00:11:54.58
But I'm tired of dating your answering[br]machine! I don't know what to do!

00:11:54.78,00:11:56.42
Well, neither do l!

00:11:58.34,00:11:59.46
Is this about Mark?

00:12:01.10,00:12:02.06
Oh, my God!

00:12:02.30,00:12:03.10
Okay, it's not.

00:12:03.30,00:12:04.58
Oh, my God!

00:12:04.82,00:12:08.90
I cannot keep having this same fight[br]over and over again.

00:12:09.10,00:12:10.66
You're making this too hard.

00:12:10.90,00:12:12.94
I'm making this too hard?[br]What should I do?

00:12:13.14,00:12:15.29
I don't know![br]I don't know! Look. . .

00:12:15.54,00:12:17.66
. . .maybe we should just take a break!

00:12:18.10,00:12:21.30
Fine, you're right.[br]Let's take a break. Let's cool off.

00:12:21.54,00:12:24.26
Let's get some frozen yogurt[br]or something.

00:12:30.10,00:12:31.86
A break from us.

00:12:45.22,00:12:47.66
--advances in collating[br]in the past five years.

00:12:48.26,00:12:50.25
We just got in an X-5000, you know?

00:12:50.46,00:12:53.22
The X-5000 makes an X-50[br]look like a T-71 .

00:12:57.06,00:12:58.46
It's the dinosaur guy!

00:12:59.86,00:13:01.30
-Hi, Ross![br]-Hi, Chloe.

00:13:01.54,00:13:04.06
I want you to meet[br]some friends of mine.

00:13:06.10,00:13:09.65
He's my hero. He'll want[br]to blow stuff up 400 percent.

00:13:09.90,00:13:14.06
We say we don't do that. He says,[br]"You gotta. " Know what? We did it.

00:13:14.38,00:13:17.98
Now anytime anybody wants 400,[br]we just say, "Let's Ross it! "

00:13:18.26,00:13:20.82
And that's the only color[br]that comes in.

00:13:22.02,00:13:25.30
Yo, Chloe! Do you have a quarter[br]for the condom machine?

00:13:28.90,00:13:32.13
What are you doing? I thought[br]tonight's your anniversary dinner.

00:13:32.34,00:13:34.06
A little change of plans.

00:13:34.26,00:13:36.25
We're gonna break up instead.

00:13:39.10,00:13:41.06
And I can speak a little French.

00:13:45.74,00:13:47.30
Why? What did I say?

00:13:47.54,00:13:50.98
Well, you just asked if I wanted[br]to go to bed with you tonight.

00:13:53.06,00:13:54.26
Oh, my God!

00:13:54.46,00:13:57.66
No wonder I get such great service[br]at Café Maurice.

00:13:58.42,00:13:59.70
Knock, knock, knock.

00:13:59.94,00:14:04.26
Hi. Could you please tell Sergei[br]that I was fascinated. . .

00:14:04.46,00:14:07.54
. . .by what Boutros Boutros-Ghali said[br]in the Times?

00:14:11.02,00:14:13.58
You didn't say[br]"Boutros Boutros-Ghali. "

00:14:13.82,00:14:15.81
Boutros Boutros-Ghali.

00:14:17.82,00:14:19.18
He says he was too.

00:14:19.38,00:14:20.53
Interesting.

00:14:22.54,00:14:24.50
So I was wondering--

00:14:24.70,00:14:26.85
Before you get all talky again. . .

00:14:27.54,00:14:30.01
. . .could you also please[br]tell Sergei. . .

00:14:31.42,00:14:33.65
. . .that I really like his suit.

00:14:46.30,00:14:48.74
He said, "Thank you.[br]You look pretty tonight.

00:14:49.14,00:14:51.90
Your hair, golden like the sun. "[br]So you're a chef?

00:14:53.38,00:14:55.85
I'm also thinking of opening up[br]my own restaurant.

00:14:56.10,00:14:57.06
Really?

00:14:57.26,00:14:59.30
Could I talk to you[br]behind my menu?

00:15:02.02,00:15:02.98
What are you doing?

00:15:03.54,00:15:05.42
Well, I was having a conversation.

00:15:05.62,00:15:10.06
Misha's so interested in you, Sergei[br]and I haven't been able to talk at all.

00:15:10.94,00:15:13.66
You want me to sit silently,[br]while you three converse?

00:15:13.90,00:15:15.46
That would be great.[br]Thank you.

00:15:23.50,00:15:25.46
Hi. It's Mark.

00:15:27.02,00:15:29.25
What? ls it my breath?

00:15:29.94,00:15:32.50
Sorry. I just thought[br]you were somebody else.

00:15:32.70,00:15:37.22
I was just gonna leave a message.[br]Isn't tonight your anniversary dinner?

00:15:40.26,00:15:41.90
Rach? Are you okay?

00:15:42.10,00:15:43.93
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:15:44.86,00:15:46.69
You wanna talk?[br]I can come over.

00:15:46.94,00:15:49.25
Really, no. Please.[br]That's okay.

00:15:49.50,00:15:51.70
All right. I'm coming over[br]with Chinese food.

00:15:51.90,00:15:53.30
I'm not hungry.

00:15:53.54,00:15:54.86
It's for me.

00:15:56.62,00:15:57.66
Bye.

00:16:01.70,00:16:03.38
-So what'll you do?[br]-What can I do?

00:16:03.62,00:16:05.85
One person wants to break up,[br]you break up.

00:16:06.06,00:16:09.29
No way. This is you guys.[br]Call her and work it out.

00:16:09.54,00:16:12.77
We just had this huge fight.[br]Don't I have to wait awhile?

00:16:13.02,00:16:17.06
It isn't like swimming after you eat.[br]Pick up the phone!

00:16:21.54,00:16:23.85
You know that[br]swimming thing is a myth.

00:16:24.06,00:16:25.86
Tell that to my Uncle Lenny.

00:16:26.34,00:16:28.06
Why? What happened to him?

00:16:28.70,00:16:31.46
Nothing. He just really[br]believes in that.

00:16:33.30,00:16:36.26
Then we got into this big fight--[br]It was awful.

00:16:36.46,00:16:41.33
I told him he treats me like[br]a park ranger, something. . . .

00:16:41.86,00:16:43.01
And then. . .

00:16:44.14,00:16:46.45
. . .I told him[br]I wanted to take a break.

00:16:46.70,00:16:49.06
I don't want to take a break.

00:16:49.50,00:16:50.86
I'm sorry.

00:16:52.06,00:16:53.05
Egg roll?

00:16:55.74,00:16:58.62
And then I called him and[br]he wasn't there.

00:16:58.82,00:17:00.34
He's probably just out.

00:17:00.54,00:17:03.46
Thank you, that's very helpful.[br]I'm glad you came over.

00:17:09.34,00:17:10.30
Hi, it's me.

00:17:10.82,00:17:12.89
Oh, I'm so glad you called.

00:17:13.14,00:17:13.97
Really?

00:17:14.22,00:17:17.42
This is crazy. Don't you think[br]we can work on this?

00:17:18.34,00:17:19.98
What do you want to drink?

00:17:20.42,00:17:21.22
Who's that?

00:17:22.82,00:17:23.86
Nobody?

00:17:24.86,00:17:27.30
Is it okay if I finish[br]the apple juice?

00:17:27.94,00:17:28.93
Is that Mark?

00:17:30.14,00:17:31.74
Honey, he just came over--

00:17:31.94,00:17:33.30
Yeah, got it!

00:17:38.54,00:17:41.10
Hey, Dinosaur Guy![br]Look at you, so sad.

00:17:41.34,00:17:42.14
Come dance.

00:17:42.34,00:17:43.86
That's okay. Thanks.

00:17:45.94,00:17:48.58
You don't have to smile.[br]You just have to dance.

00:17:48.78,00:17:52.30
I don't feel like dancing.[br]I feel like having a drink, okay?

00:17:52.54,00:17:54.26
Two beers!

00:17:56.02,00:17:58.09
And the vet said it was time.

00:17:58.34,00:18:00.25
And so from half a world away. . .

00:18:00.46,00:18:03.06
. . .while my mother[br]held the phone to his ear. . .

00:18:03.30,00:18:06.26
. . .I said goodbye to my dog. . .

00:18:06.74,00:18:08.50
. . .in seven languages.

00:18:10.54,00:18:12.45
-Could I have a tissue?[br]-Oh, sure.

00:18:12.66,00:18:14.81
I just hope you don't accidentally. . .

00:18:15.02,00:18:17.46
. . .suck it up through your nose[br]and choke on it.

00:18:23.10,00:18:26.78
Sergei would like to apologize[br]for my behavior tonight.

00:18:28.06,00:18:30.34
Well, tell him, "Apology accepted. "

00:18:33.14,00:18:37.26
Unbelievable. For the first time in[br]years, someone wants to talk to me.

00:18:37.46,00:18:40.66
But do you think he would[br]let me enjoy that? No!

00:18:41.54,00:18:44.85
You silly diplomat.[br]Why don't you learn some English?

00:18:46.94,00:18:50.30
Excuse me, but isn't he paying[br]for your dinner?

00:18:50.50,00:18:52.38
The man's dog just died.

00:19:09.74,00:19:11.70
I have just resigned my post.

00:19:11.90,00:19:14.21
Will you accompany me[br]to the Rainbow Room?

00:19:14.42,00:19:16.10
I have diplomatic coupons.

00:19:18.74,00:19:20.65
It would be my pleasure.

00:19:21.34,00:19:23.41
My guy has coupons.

00:19:25.06,00:19:27.66
Your guy can't even say "coupons. "

00:19:34.74,00:19:35.54
Plate.

00:19:35.94,00:19:37.70
Plate! Yes! Plate!

00:19:41.54,00:19:43.26
See, we don't need them.

00:19:57.50,00:19:58.86
I like this song.

00:20:00.14,00:20:02.45
Well, you're practically[br]dancing, already.

00:20:03.62,00:20:05.85
Why don't you just do it over here?

00:20:06.74,00:20:08.10
What are you, married?

00:20:09.10,00:20:10.46
Because that's okay.

00:20:25.14,00:20:27.86
Oh, be home, be home, be home. . . .

00:20:34.06,00:20:35.46
You're not home.

00:20:46.14,00:20:47.21
Still no smile?

00:21:21.26,00:21:23.65
--Miss American Pie

00:21:24.30,00:21:25.53
Ameri-can.

00:21:28.54,00:21:30.50
It's a very hard language.

00:21:31.34,00:21:32.54
Let's do it again.
