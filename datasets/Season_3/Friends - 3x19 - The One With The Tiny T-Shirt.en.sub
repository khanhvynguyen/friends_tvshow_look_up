00:00:03.10,00:00:05.25
-Here you go.[br]-Thank you.

00:00:07.10,00:00:08.17
"Say, Rachel...

00:00:08.42,00:00:11.34
...l was wondering if you'd[br]go to a movie with me sometime...

00:00:11.54,00:00:13.02
...as my lover. "

00:00:16.22,00:00:17.37
Too out there.

00:00:17.62,00:00:20.30
"Maybe you'd like to have[br]dinner with me sometime...

00:00:21.18,00:00:22.58
...as my lover. "

00:00:26.74,00:00:28.38
All right, let's go shopping.

00:00:28.66,00:00:31.18
Before we go, there's something[br]I need to say.

00:00:36.62,00:00:39.06
I've kind of had this crush on you.

00:00:40.14,00:00:42.86
Since you were with Ross,[br]I didn't do anything about it.

00:00:43.10,00:00:46.86
Now that you're not, I'd really[br]like to ask you out sometime.

00:00:47.50,00:00:49.46
So that's what I'm doing. . .

00:00:49.78,00:00:50.61
: : :now:

00:01:06.30,00:01:07.58
I dropped a cup.

00:01:09.34,00:01:11.46
The One With the Tiny T-Shirt

00:01:12.70,00:01:13.69
Subtitles and Rip by[br].:staz:. (staz@post.cz)

00:01:56.86,00:01:59.54
So within a few years,[br]voice recognition. . .

00:01:59.78,00:02:01.78
. . .will be standard[br]on any computer.

00:02:02.18,00:02:06.50
You know, so you could be, like,[br]"Wash my car. " "Clean my room. "

00:02:06.70,00:02:10.33
It won't be able to do any of those[br]things, but it'll understand.

00:02:11.74,00:02:12.97
Oh, this was so great.

00:02:13.18,00:02:14.46
Yeah, it was.

00:02:16.14,00:02:17.21
All right, then.

00:02:18.78,00:02:20.06
Bye.

00:02:25.58,00:02:28.14
Hello, people who do not live here.

00:02:32.22,00:02:34.37
I gave you a key for emergencies.

00:02:34.62,00:02:36.62
We were out of Doritos.

00:02:38.14,00:02:40.74
Hey, how'd the date go[br]with Mr. Millionaire?

00:02:40.94,00:02:43.94
"Mr. Millionaire.[br]New, from Snooty Playthings.

00:02:44.78,00:02:46.58
Third wife sold separately. "

00:02:47.54,00:02:50.26
He's great. We have such[br]a good time together.

00:02:50.50,00:02:55.34
He's so funny and so sweet.[br]And I'm not attracted to him at all!

00:02:55.74,00:02:56.73
Still?

00:02:57.66,00:03:01.13
It's driving me crazy. In every[br]other way, he's the perfect guy.

00:03:01.34,00:03:05.18
He has everything.[br]Plus, he actually has everything.

00:03:05.82,00:03:08.78
Life-sized lmperial Storm Troopers[br]from Sharper lmage?

00:03:09.02,00:03:10.42
Two.

00:03:10.98,00:03:13.05
Can Joey and I put them on and fight?

00:03:15.42,00:03:19.46
Oh, Mommy! Oh, Daddy![br]I am a big old baddy

00:03:20.22,00:03:23.74
Oh, Mommy! Oh, Daddy![br]I am a big old baddy

00:03:27.54,00:03:30.62
I guess he must've gotten the part[br]in that play.

00:03:30.82,00:03:32.74
Either that, or Gloria Estefan[br]was right.

00:03:32.98,00:03:35.34
Eventually, the rhythm[br]is going to get you.

00:03:41.02,00:03:42.98
-Joe, how's it going?[br]-Good.

00:03:50.30,00:03:51.86
So you're playing Adrianne?

00:03:52.10,00:03:54.49
Yes. Are you one of the[br]retarded cousins?

00:03:56.62,00:04:00.06
No. I'm playing your husband, victor.[br]I'm Joey Tribbiani.

00:04:00.30,00:04:02.53
Hi. Nice to meet you.[br]Kate Miller.

00:04:09.22,00:04:11.53
So the play's pretty great, huh?

00:04:11.78,00:04:14.14
Oh, yeah.[br]I love Jennifer Banberry's work.

00:04:14.38,00:04:18.34
She's so incisive when it comes[br]to deconstructing the middle class.

00:04:18.54,00:04:20.69
Oh, forget about it. She rocks!

00:04:26.10,00:04:28.14
Where do I know you from?

00:04:29.62,00:04:31.22
Dr. Drake Ramoray?

00:04:32.54,00:04:33.82
Days of our Lives?

00:04:34.30,00:04:36.98
voted most datable neurosurgeon[br]by Teen Beat?

00:04:38.30,00:04:39.82
No, that's not it.

00:04:40.82,00:04:42.54
So you're a soap actor.

00:04:42.74,00:04:45.86
This must be exciting for you,[br]being in a real play.

00:04:46.06,00:04:48.74
Hey, I've done plays before.[br]I'm a serious actor.

00:04:50.14,00:04:51.18
That infomercial!

00:04:53.38,00:04:55.18
For the milk-carton-spout thing!

00:04:55.42,00:04:57.89
You're the guy who doesn't[br]know how to pour milk!

00:04:59.42,00:05:03.50
I actually can pour milk. But I got[br]you believing that I couldn't.

00:05:03.70,00:05:05.26
Now, see, that's acting.

00:05:05.90,00:05:08.54
Right. At the end, you choked[br]on a cookie.

00:05:08.98,00:05:09.86
That was real.

00:05:12.10,00:05:15.18
-I cannot believe Mark asked you out.[br]-I know.

00:05:15.42,00:05:17.14
What are you gonna tell him?

00:05:17.34,00:05:21.18
I told him I would think about it,[br]but I'm gonna tell him no.

00:05:23.42,00:05:25.94
I think I'd say no[br]to anybody right now.

00:05:29.10,00:05:32.18
But it was so strange.[br]I mean, I'm standing there. . .

00:05:32.42,00:05:36.54
. . .with this charming, cute guy[br]who's asking me to go out with him. . .

00:05:36.74,00:05:38.54
. . .which I'm allowed to do. . .

00:05:38.78,00:05:42.57
. . .and I felt guilty, like I'd be[br]cheating on Ross or something.

00:05:43.18,00:05:46.18
Wow. So, okay, maybe that means. . .

00:05:46.38,00:05:50.14
. . .you're not over Ross yet[br]and you have issues with your father.

00:05:53.98,00:05:57.58
-I don't have issues with my father.[br]-So it's just the Ross thing.

00:05:59.82,00:06:01.74
I hate this woman! I hate her!

00:06:01.94,00:06:04.33
She told everyone[br]about that infomercial. . .

00:06:04.54,00:06:07.54
. . .and now they all keep asking me[br]to open their drinks!

00:06:07.78,00:06:11.86
And whenever I can't do it,[br]they're all, like, laughing at me!

00:06:17.02,00:06:18.50
So Rachel called.

00:06:19.78,00:06:21.10
Wants to see me.

00:06:22.54,00:06:24.02
Going over in a minute.

00:06:24.74,00:06:29.14
-What do you think she wants?[br]-Maybe the crazy fog has lifted. . .

00:06:29.38,00:06:32.30
. . .and she realizes that life[br]without me. . .

00:06:32.78,00:06:33.58
. . .sucks.

00:06:34.82,00:06:39.53
It's possible. You are very lovable.[br]I'd miss you if I broke up with you.

00:06:40.58,00:06:42.22
Just trying to be supportive.

00:06:43.34,00:06:45.10
Be supportive like a guy.

00:06:46.26,00:06:48.54
If I broke up with you, I'd miss you.

00:06:56.74,00:06:58.18
You wanted to see me?

00:07:03.14,00:07:05.53
Here's a box of your stuff.

00:07:09.14,00:07:13.70
It's just hats and a shirt and CDS.[br]Just stuff that you've left here.

00:07:14.30,00:07:17.54
What are you doing? Are you trying[br]to hurt me or something?

00:07:23.42,00:07:27.13
It just seems that, you know,[br]it's time we move on.

00:07:27.38,00:07:28.78
I mean, don't you think?

00:07:32.22,00:07:33.66
-Yes, I do.[br]-Good.

00:07:34.38,00:07:35.86
I really do.

00:07:39.54,00:07:41.46
This was a gift.

00:07:41.66,00:07:44.54
You got that for free[br]from the museum gift shop.

00:07:45.02,00:07:46.54
It's still a gift.

00:07:46.78,00:07:49.17
I got it from the "gift" shop.

00:07:50.82,00:07:53.74
Okay! All right! Give me the mug![br]I'll keep the mug!

00:07:53.98,00:07:55.38
Don't do me any favors.

00:07:55.62,00:07:56.98
In fact. . .

00:07:57.70,00:08:00.26
. . .where's the rest of my stuff?[br]Like my. . . .

00:08:02.58,00:08:04.14
This book is mine!

00:08:06.82,00:08:10.86
And that T-shirt you sleep in?[br]I'd like that back too. Yes, I do.

00:08:12.62,00:08:16.94
You know how much I love that T-shirt.[br]You never even wear that T-shirt.

00:08:17.30,00:08:19.66
I'm just trying to help you "move on. "

00:08:20.62,00:08:23.06
Oh, you are a petty man.

00:08:23.30,00:08:25.34
You are a petty, petty. . .

00:08:25.54,00:08:26.94
-Petty. . .[br]-. . . petty, petty. . .

00:08:27.18,00:08:28.38
-. . .small. . . .[br]-. . .small. . . .

00:08:32.26,00:08:35.34
You are so just doing this[br]out of spite.

00:08:36.46,00:08:39.38
I'm gonna wear this all the time![br]I love this shirt!

00:08:40.02,00:08:44.89
You haven't worn it since you were 1 5![br]It doesn't even fit you anymore!

00:08:59.62,00:09:02.93
If you don't mind, I'm gonna[br]take the rest of my stuff. . .

00:09:03.42,00:09:05.02
. . .and "relax" . . .

00:09:06.30,00:09:08.26
. . .in my favorite shirt.

00:09:10.14,00:09:12.14
You have a pleasant evening.

00:09:21.54,00:09:23.34
So you're, like, a zillionaire.

00:09:25.06,00:09:27.26
And you're our age.[br]You're our age.

00:09:27.98,00:09:30.45
You know what?[br]You should buy a state. . .

00:09:30.70,00:09:32.82
. . .and then just name it[br]after yourself.

00:09:33.42,00:09:34.70
Like, "Pete Dakota"?

00:09:36.38,00:09:37.94
Or "Mississi-Pete. "

00:09:39.78,00:09:42.22
I got it: "Pete Chicago. "

00:09:44.14,00:09:45.98
That's not a state, Joe.

00:09:46.42,00:09:48.73
Oh, and "Mississi-Pete" is?

00:09:50.74,00:09:52.10
I gotta go.

00:09:52.70,00:09:54.14
I'll see you guys later.

00:09:54.34,00:09:55.86
You're our age.

00:09:58.22,00:09:59.86
So are we on for tomorrow?

00:10:00.10,00:10:01.33
Absolutely.

00:10:03.14,00:10:05.34
Now, get out of here, you!

00:10:11.38,00:10:14.34
Okay, I'm running out of places[br]I can touch him.

00:10:14.98,00:10:16.42
Is something wrong with me?

00:10:16.66,00:10:19.26
Why am I only attracted to guys[br]with no future?

00:10:19.50,00:10:22.02
Either they're too old,[br]or they're too young.

00:10:22.26,00:10:24.26
And there's Pete,[br]who's crazy about me. . .

00:10:24.50,00:10:27.74
. . .and he's absolutely perfect,[br]and there's zip going on!

00:10:27.94,00:10:30.06
Does it sound like[br]something's wrong with me?

00:10:30.30,00:10:31.42
Yeah, kind of.

00:10:34.54,00:10:37.34
Happy? ls that what I'm[br]supposed to be, vic?

00:10:37.58,00:10:38.78
Happy?

00:10:39.02,00:10:41.54
Why don't you tell me what[br]you're supposed to be?

00:10:41.74,00:10:43.94
Because I sure as hell can't[br]figure it out!

00:10:44.14,00:10:46.34
I talk to you, and nothing!

00:10:46.58,00:10:48.58
You look at me, and it's nothing!

00:10:52.10,00:10:53.25
Nothing.

00:10:55.82,00:10:56.81
Tasty.

00:10:58.46,00:11:02.42
I'm really starting to feel like[br]you guys have a history. It's nice.

00:11:02.66,00:11:04.58
I have a question about this scene.

00:11:05.70,00:11:09.22
I don't understand why Adrianne's[br]attracted to victor.

00:11:09.46,00:11:11.14
Peel the onion.

00:11:12.22,00:11:14.10
First of all, he's good-looking.

00:11:15.82,00:11:18.58
My character needs a bit more[br]of a reason than that.

00:11:18.82,00:11:21.98
Hey, how about this one?[br]It says so in the script!

00:11:24.82,00:11:27.54
I don't know why my character[br]likes you either.

00:11:27.78,00:11:30.54
I mean, it says in the script[br]that you're a bitch.

00:11:31.42,00:11:34.54
-It doesn't say that in the script.[br]-It does in mine.

00:11:37.34,00:11:39.98
I can blow-dry it, gel it.[br]It doesn't matter.

00:11:40.22,00:11:41.94
I still wind up with this little. . .

00:11:42.18,00:11:46.38
. . .cowlick-y thing on the middle part[br]of my head. It's so annoying.

00:11:46.58,00:11:48.70
-Does it bug you?[br]-You bug me.

00:12:01.50,00:12:04.30
Is there any chance[br]you didn't see that?

00:12:07.78,00:12:09.93
Ross, you gotta stop, okay?

00:12:10.18,00:12:12.94
You can't stare through[br]the peephole for three hours.

00:12:15.54,00:12:17.06
You're gonna get peep-eye.

00:12:18.14,00:12:20.94
I knew it. I knew it.[br]I always knew she liked him.

00:12:21.30,00:12:25.74
She'd say no, but here we are. We just[br]broke up, first thing she does!

00:12:25.94,00:12:27.38
You didn't "just break up. "

00:12:27.62,00:12:29.38
It's been, like, three weeks!

00:12:29.62,00:12:33.38
You slept with somebody three hours[br]after you thought you broke up.

00:12:33.62,00:12:35.82
I mean, bullets have left guns slower.

00:12:37.38,00:12:39.02
Here they come! Here they--

00:12:39.34,00:12:42.02
If she kisses him good night,[br]I'll kill myself.

00:12:42.26,00:12:43.70
I can't watch.

00:12:44.94,00:12:46.86
Come on.[br]Date over! Date over!

00:12:47.62,00:12:49.74
Here we go. She's going in.

00:12:50.46,00:12:51.53
She's going in.

00:12:51.78,00:12:53.54
Wait! He's going in!

00:12:54.82,00:12:55.94
He's going in!

00:12:56.38,00:13:00.14
The door's closed! I can't see[br]anything with the door closed!

00:13:00.42,00:13:03.94
And the inventor of the door[br]rests happily in his grave.

00:13:04.42,00:13:06.73
I have to do something.[br]I have to stop it!

00:13:06.98,00:13:08.78
-Stop what?[br]-I don't know.

00:13:09.02,00:13:11.49
But I have a feeling[br]my being there will do it.

00:13:11.70,00:13:13.98
I'll go over and I will[br]borrow something!

00:13:14.34,00:13:15.98
Juice! I need juice!

00:13:16.22,00:13:17.10
You can't!

00:13:18.22,00:13:20.37
-They must be stopped![br]-I am your friend. . .

00:13:20.62,00:13:22.46
. . .and I won't let you do this!

00:13:22.74,00:13:24.89
You are surprisingly strong!

00:13:25.78,00:13:29.14
-I need juice! People need juice![br]-Look, man. . . .

00:13:29.34,00:13:31.22
-People need juice![br]-Listen to me!

00:13:35.82,00:13:39.86
She's moving on. If it's not[br]this guy, it's gonna be somebody else.

00:13:40.10,00:13:42.94
And unless you're thinking about[br]subletting my peephole. . .

00:13:43.14,00:13:46.22
. . .you'll have to get used to the fact[br]that it's over!

00:13:46.46,00:13:49.06
Okay, man? It's over.

00:13:55.62,00:13:57.82
It's just I miss her so much.

00:13:59.22,00:14:00.29
I know.

00:14:03.02,00:14:05.17
Why do your coffee mugs have numbers?

00:14:05.42,00:14:07.94
Oh, that's so Monica can keep track.

00:14:08.18,00:14:11.73
So if one of them's missing,[br]she can be like, "Where's number 27?"

00:14:20.50,00:14:21.38
You know what?

00:14:21.62,00:14:24.22
No, and I don't think[br]I'm gonna want to.

00:14:24.98,00:14:28.42
-I can't do this.[br]-That's what I didn't want to know.

00:14:28.82,00:14:32.58
Oh, I'm just doing this[br]for the wrong reasons, you know?

00:14:32.78,00:14:34.70
I'm doing it to get back at Ross.

00:14:34.90,00:14:37.37
I'm sorry. It's not very fair to you.

00:14:40.34,00:14:41.94
Fair, shmair. You know?

00:14:42.14,00:14:45.18
You wanna get back at Ross,[br]I am here for you.

00:14:46.38,00:14:47.42
Really.

00:14:47.66,00:14:52.14
I say we get back at him right here[br]on this couch. Right here!

00:14:53.82,00:14:55.78
Oh, my God.

00:14:57.50,00:14:58.94
I'm sorry about this.

00:15:00.42,00:15:01.49
That's okay.

00:15:03.54,00:15:04.34
You sure?

00:15:07.38,00:15:10.38
I can just go home and get back[br]at him by myself.

00:15:13.98,00:15:16.86
--and should become the penicillin[br]of the 2 1st century.

00:15:17.10,00:15:20.73
And so today, this hospital[br]is about to take major steps. . .

00:15:20.98,00:15:23.29
. . .toward leading that revolution.

00:15:24.98,00:15:26.46
Can I ask you something?

00:15:30.42,00:15:31.25
Where are we?

00:15:32.22,00:15:35.34
Well, with all these doctors[br]and nurses. . .

00:15:35.58,00:15:37.46
. . .I'm gonna say, "Midget Rodeo. "

00:15:38.50,00:15:39.86
Just tell me the truth.

00:15:45.18,00:15:47.74
You know, I don't think[br]I told you this. . .

00:15:47.94,00:15:51.18
. . .but I just recently got out[br]of a serious relationship.

00:15:51.42,00:15:53.62
Oh, right.[br]Wasn't that a year ago?

00:15:55.62,00:15:57.14
So I did tell you.

00:15:57.90,00:15:59.78
That's not really the thing.

00:16:00.02,00:16:04.81
I'm just in a place in my life[br]where I need to focus on me.

00:16:05.34,00:16:07.38
-Do you know what I mean?[br]-Oh, I know.

00:16:09.54,00:16:13.78
-I so want to be attracted to you.[br]-But you're not. Okay. Good.

00:16:14.02,00:16:15.17
I'm sorry.

00:16:17.54,00:16:19.34
You know what? Don't be.

00:16:20.30,00:16:22.37
Don't be, because it's not so bad.

00:16:23.14,00:16:23.94
It's not?

00:16:24.14,00:16:26.58
Yeah. I know I'm no Jon Bon Jovi.

00:16:28.90,00:16:31.21
Or someone you find attractive.

00:16:32.22,00:16:34.18
I just think, you know. . .

00:16:34.42,00:16:37.89
. . .that you might end up[br]feeling differently.

00:16:41.22,00:16:43.98
I don't want this[br]to come out wrong. . .

00:16:44.18,00:16:47.97
. . .but you're awfully confident for a[br]guy I said I wasn't attracted to.

00:16:48.22,00:16:50.34
Stupidly charming, isn't it?

00:16:52.90,00:16:56.69
You wanna get something to eat?[br]This place is kind of depressing.

00:16:57.70,00:17:02.49
Now the man who made all of this[br]possible, Mr. Peter Becker.

00:17:03.06,00:17:04.10
One second.

00:17:11.54,00:17:16.06
I don't think this town is big enough[br]for the both of us to relax in.

00:17:19.18,00:17:20.33
Draw!

00:17:24.02,00:17:25.58
I wasn't doing anything.

00:17:32.54,00:17:34.18
What did she do now?

00:17:34.42,00:17:38.94
Just because she went to Yale, she[br]thinks she's the greatest actress. . .

00:17:39.14,00:17:41.29
. . .since sliced bread.

00:17:42.30,00:17:45.34
Ah, Sliced Bread.[br]A wonderful Lady Macbeth.

00:17:46.02,00:17:49.57
I hate her. I hate her[br]with her "Oh, I'm so talented" . . .

00:17:49.82,00:17:53.53
. . .and "Oh, I'm so pretty,"[br]and "Oh, I smell so good. "

00:17:54.50,00:17:56.73
I think somebody has a crush[br]on somebody.

00:17:56.98,00:18:00.86
Can we please try and stay focused[br]on my problem here?

00:18:01.38,00:18:04.30
I'm talking about you,[br]you big, big freak.

00:18:08.42,00:18:10.14
You're out of your mind!

00:18:10.38,00:18:12.98
You've done nothing but talk[br]about her for 48 hours.

00:18:13.18,00:18:17.74
If you were in school, you'd be pulling[br]her pigtails and pushing her down now.

00:18:17.94,00:18:20.17
Then how come I keep thinking[br]about her. . .

00:18:20.42,00:18:23.18
. . .in all these sexual scenarios[br]and stuff?

00:18:29.34,00:18:33.18
Happy? ls that what I'm[br]supposed to be, vic? Happy?

00:18:33.42,00:18:36.18
Why don't you tell me what[br]you're supposed to be, huh?

00:18:36.42,00:18:38.65
Because I sure as hell can't[br]figure it out.

00:18:38.90,00:18:40.90
I talk to you, and it's nothing.

00:18:41.42,00:18:43.65
You look at me, and nothing.

00:18:56.50,00:18:57.65
Nothing.

00:18:59.70,00:19:03.09
You guys make me fly!

00:19:05.62,00:19:06.90
High!

00:19:08.02,00:19:10.74
Okay, we're gonna pick it up[br]here, tomorrow.

00:19:12.90,00:19:15.18
-Well, that was. . . .[br]-Better?

00:19:16.22,00:19:18.45
Yeah, it was definitely. . .

00:19:18.70,00:19:20.18
. . .an improvement.

00:19:21.62,00:19:23.46
-Good night.[br]-Kate.

00:19:25.54,00:19:26.77
You forgot your shoes.

00:19:29.22,00:19:31.69
I'm probably gonna need those, huh?

00:19:36.42,00:19:37.70
Hey, listen. . .

00:19:38.82,00:19:40.94
. . .you feel like getting[br]a cup of coffee?

00:19:42.42,00:19:43.33
Kate. . .

00:19:43.54,00:19:44.45
. . .you ready to go?

00:19:47.10,00:19:49.38
very nice. very nice.

00:19:54.38,00:19:56.18
-See you tomorrow?[br]-Yeah. Sure.

00:19:56.42,00:19:57.74
-Right.[br]-Good night.

00:20:10.50,00:20:12.30
Why isn't it "Spiderman"?

00:20:12.90,00:20:14.66
Like Goldman, Silverman?

00:20:15.54,00:20:17.74
Because it's not his last name.

00:20:18.22,00:20:19.02
It isn't?

00:20:19.26,00:20:20.94
It's not, like. . .

00:20:21.14,00:20:22.74
. . .Phil Spiderman.

00:20:25.62,00:20:26.74
He's a Spider-. . .

00:20:26.98,00:20:28.54
: : :man:

00:20:29.58,00:20:32.46
You know, like, Goldman[br]is a last name.

00:20:32.70,00:20:35.09
But there's no Gold Man.

00:20:37.62,00:20:39.22
There should be a Gold Man!

00:20:43.54,00:20:44.94
-How was work?[br]-Oh, great.

00:20:45.18,00:20:47.94
Although I did sit down[br]where there wasn't a chair.

00:20:48.82,00:20:51.13
By the way, Ross dropped by[br]a box of your stuff.

00:20:51.38,00:20:54.30
Oh. Well, I guess I had[br]that one coming.

00:20:55.02,00:20:58.22
I'm just gonna throw it out.[br]It's probably just shampoo and--

00:21:00.02,00:21:01.22
Something wrong?

00:21:10.38,00:21:11.82
No. Nothing.

00:21:18.70,00:21:22.14
So what kind of powers[br]would "Gold Man" have?

00:21:23.30,00:21:26.34
Okay. Well, he would turn things[br]to gold.

00:21:26.94,00:21:30.90
-And things that are already gold?[br]-His work is done.

00:21:32.50,00:21:33.65
Let's play my game.

00:21:35.10,00:21:38.57
All right, you yellow-bellied,[br]lily-livered--

00:21:38.82,00:21:39.78
Draw!

00:21:43.38,00:21:44.21
Yeah, it's fun.
