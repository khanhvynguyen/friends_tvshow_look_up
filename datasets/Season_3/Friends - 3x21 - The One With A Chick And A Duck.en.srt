00:00:03.38,00:00:06.26
Whose idea was it to put[br]everybody in the diner on skates?

00:00:06.46,00:00:09.45
Some idiot customer put a suggestion[br]in the suggestion box.

00:00:09.66,00:00:12.49
-Oh, my God! They took my idea![br]-That was you?

00:00:13.50,00:00:14.85
Okay, there you go.

00:00:15.46,00:00:17.21
Rachel, I made you cocoa.

00:00:17.42,00:00:18.90
Oh, that's so. . . .

00:00:20.54,00:00:22.89
Oh, my God! Are you guys okay?

00:00:26.18,00:00:27.45
Oh, my.

00:01:20.46,00:01:23.49
You know, with that goatee,[br]you kind of look like Satan.

00:01:25.14,00:01:28.21
So that's why the priest[br]threw holy water on me.

00:01:30.46,00:01:31.86
You have to cheer up.

00:01:32.38,00:01:34.49
You should come out with Ross and me.

00:01:34.70,00:01:38.29
Anything is better than sitting[br]here crying all day about Kate.

00:01:38.54,00:01:43.21
I was crying because[br]nobody believed Quincy's theory.

00:01:45.02,00:01:46.34
I'm gonna be on Tv!

00:01:46.58,00:01:47.81
No way!

00:01:48.06,00:01:51.53
They're putting together a panel[br]to talk about the fossils in Peru.

00:01:51.74,00:01:53.25
The Discovery Channel's filming it!

00:01:53.46,00:01:57.05
Oh, my God![br]Who's gonna watch that?

00:01:58.46,00:02:00.05
Thanks. You ready to go?

00:02:00.50,00:02:02.22
I saw a girl with that vest.

00:02:02.46,00:02:03.45
Thanks.

00:02:05.94,00:02:09.90
Most of us think of chocolate and[br]baskets as traditional Easter gifts.

00:02:10.10,00:02:13.06
Some people insist on[br]giving live chicks as presents.

00:02:14.18,00:02:19.09
Unfortunately, most of these guys[br]won 't live to see the 4th of July.

00:02:19.30,00:02:22.45
As a result of improper care,[br]they will be dead.

00:02:22.98,00:02:24.70
You guys got any of those baby chicks?

00:02:24.90,00:02:29.81
I was watching this commercial on Tv,[br]and, man, those things are cute!

00:02:33.42,00:02:36.89
Pete, you're back![br]Hey, check this out!

00:02:37.18,00:02:39.13
Skates!

00:02:42.46,00:02:46.09
You're sturdier than Chandler.[br]He crumbled like a piece of paper.

00:02:46.34,00:02:47.37
How was your trip?

00:02:48.18,00:02:50.09
What'd you bring me?

00:02:51.38,00:02:54.53
Hotel toiletries from Japan!

00:02:54.78,00:02:56.85
These are gonna go[br]in my permanent collection.

00:02:57.54,00:02:59.37
-Want some coffee?[br]-That'd be great.

00:03:03.38,00:03:04.57
Regular or decaf?

00:03:05.46,00:03:06.94
Whichever's closest.

00:03:08.46,00:03:11.21
-Ask me what I did today.[br]-What did you do today?

00:03:11.42,00:03:14.89
I bought a restaurant[br]and I'd like you to be the chef.

00:03:20.38,00:03:22.49
Can you believe he[br]offered me a restaurant?

00:03:22.74,00:03:25.70
What a jerk.[br]You want me to kick his ass?

00:03:26.38,00:03:29.13
It's been my dream since[br]I got my first Easy-Bake Oven. . .

00:03:29.38,00:03:31.89
. . .and opened Easy-Monica's Bakery.

00:03:38.58,00:03:41.73
I would kill for this job.[br]I can totally do this job. . .

00:03:41.98,00:03:45.49
. . .and God knows, I've paid my dues.

00:03:46.90,00:03:49.54
But Pete's doing this[br]because he has a crush on me.

00:03:49.78,00:03:52.29
And you're still not[br]attracted to him at all?

00:03:53.78,00:03:56.29
How could I accept a restaurant[br]from him? I can't.

00:03:56.54,00:03:59.53
I couldn't accept a necklace[br]from Stu vincent in the 7th grade.

00:03:59.74,00:04:03.70
But, Mon, that was totally different.[br]He was your health teacher.

00:04:04.90,00:04:06.30
What, honey?

00:04:06.74,00:04:09.21
My side hurts from when[br]you crashed into me.

00:04:09.46,00:04:10.94
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

00:04:11.18,00:04:12.37
Oh, God!

00:04:13.26,00:04:14.85
Hey, you guys. Guess what?

00:04:19.46,00:04:21.02
Got a job on a riverboat?

00:04:23.14,00:04:26.05
I didn't wear this suit for a year,[br]because you hated it.

00:04:26.30,00:04:28.33
You're not my girlfriend[br]anymore, so: : : :

00:04:28.58,00:04:30.69
I see. This suit is making a point.

00:04:30.94,00:04:35.01
Now that you're on your own, you're[br]free to look as stupid as you'd like.

00:04:35.74,00:04:36.61
You like it, right?

00:04:36.86,00:04:40.17
I like it even more on you[br]than I did on Colonel Sanders.

00:04:41.02,00:04:42.69
Ross, I'm kidding. Come here.

00:04:42.90,00:04:44.49
What were you gonna tell us?

00:04:44.70,00:04:47.26
Was it how you[br]invented the cotton gin?

00:04:48.82,00:04:51.38
So after you put the suggestion[br]in the box. . .

00:04:51.62,00:04:53.85
. . .how long did it take[br]for it to happen?

00:04:54.10,00:04:55.74
About three months.

00:04:55.98,00:05:00.26
So I guess that's about two weeks[br]before the topless thing kicks in.

00:05:05.58,00:05:08.69
I got you something.[br]Open it! Open it!

00:05:15.90,00:05:17.38
It's a chicken.

00:05:18.74,00:05:19.97
It's cute, huh?

00:05:20.18,00:05:22.41
You guys? Do you know[br]anything about chicks?

00:05:22.66,00:05:24.73
Fowl? No.

00:05:25.06,00:05:27.25
Women? No.

00:05:28.30,00:05:30.49
They are a huge responsibility.

00:05:30.74,00:05:33.41
Especially at this age.[br]They require constant care.

00:05:33.66,00:05:36.69
They need just the right food[br]and lots and lots of love.

00:05:36.94,00:05:39.33
Well, no problem there.

00:05:44.66,00:05:45.65
Easy, Lenny.

00:05:50.46,00:05:53.10
So, I mean, have you thought about it?

00:05:53.38,00:05:54.57
Okay, here's the thing.

00:05:54.82,00:05:57.62
Not "the thing. "[br]I hate "the thing. "

00:05:57.82,00:05:59.01
What's "the thing"?

00:06:00.58,00:06:01.73
I can't do it.

00:06:01.98,00:06:03.73
I'm sorry. I wish I could. . .

00:06:03.98,00:06:06.65
. . .but you have these feelings for me.

00:06:06.90,00:06:08.93
That's what you're worried about?

00:06:09.18,00:06:11.69
If that's the problem,[br]we've got no problem.

00:06:12.90,00:06:16.45
I was gonna tell you over dinner,[br]but I met somebody else, on my trip.

00:06:17.94,00:06:20.77
Her name's Ann. She's a journalist.[br]We met on the plane.

00:06:20.98,00:06:22.38
She wanted to finish off[br]my peanuts.

00:06:22.58,00:06:25.41
I thought she said something else.[br]We had a big laugh.

00:06:28.10,00:06:30.33
I got tired of waiting.

00:06:30.58,00:06:35.49
That's great. I'm sorry,[br]but I'm so happy for you.

00:06:35.86,00:06:37.89
-Now I can work for you![br]-I guess you can.

00:06:38.14,00:06:41.89
Oh, my God! This is incredible!

00:06:42.74,00:06:46.13
You know what? I'm gonna roll[br]right into that office and quit!

00:06:46.38,00:06:47.89
All right!

00:06:48.34,00:06:50.25
Could you give me a little push?

00:06:50.50,00:06:51.29
Good luck!

00:06:51.54,00:06:53.21
I'm quitting!

00:06:57.26,00:06:59.49
I'm okay! I'm all right!

00:07:02.66,00:07:06.21
That's exciting.[br]You went to Japan, made up a woman.

00:07:06.78,00:07:07.97
What?

00:07:08.26,00:07:12.01
I'm just saying, this "woman,"[br]I mean, she's fictitious, no?

00:07:12.86,00:07:14.97
-Why would you say that?[br]-You're still into Monica.

00:07:15.22,00:07:18.05
You said there's somebody else[br]so she'd work with you.

00:07:18.30,00:07:21.41
If you spend time together,[br]maybe something might happen.

00:07:22.78,00:07:24.65
You're good. You're good.

00:07:25.42,00:07:28.38
No, I'm fairly intuitive. And psychic.

00:07:28.78,00:07:30.69
It's a substantial gift.

00:07:32.06,00:07:34.53
Can you promise me[br]that you won't tell her?

00:07:34.78,00:07:38.29
Absolutely. I promise.[br]Tell her what?

00:07:39.18,00:07:40.37
Thanks a lot.

00:07:40.70,00:07:43.29
No, I'm serious.[br]I'm intuitive, but my memory sucks.

00:07:45.46,00:07:47.49
Okay, but this is the last time.

00:07:48.18,00:07:50.90
With a chick-chick here[br]And a chick-chick there

00:07:51.14,00:07:53.70
Here a chick, there a chick[br]Everywhere a chick-chick

00:07:53.94,00:07:55.29
Chicken....

00:07:58.98,00:08:00.49
How's she doing?

00:08:00.86,00:08:01.85
She?

00:08:02.46,00:08:04.10
Don't you think it's a she?

00:08:04.90,00:08:06.22
I don't know.

00:08:15.90,00:08:18.49
I can't tell. Whatever it was[br]went back in too quickly.

00:08:19.94,00:08:22.90
I gotta change. I'm meeting[br]some of the cast for drinks.

00:08:23.14,00:08:24.25
Excuse me?

00:08:24.50,00:08:25.49
What?

00:08:25.94,00:08:27.97
I stayed home while[br]you were at rehearsal. . .

00:08:28.22,00:08:30.65
. . .so somebody could be here[br]with our chick.

00:08:30.94,00:08:34.73
Who was up from 2:00 this[br]morning until 5:00. . .

00:08:34.98,00:08:36.89
. . .trying to get her back to sleep?

00:08:37.46,00:08:39.37
You don't think I get up[br]when you get up?

00:08:40.42,00:08:41.61
Oh, here it comes.

00:08:41.86,00:08:45.29
Yes! Here it comes![br]I'm stuck here all day!

00:08:45.54,00:08:48.45
And then you come in[br]and spend two seconds with us. . .

00:08:50.18,00:08:53.41
. . .and then expect to go off[br]gallivanting with your friends?

00:08:53.66,00:08:55.53
Well, I don't think so, mister!

00:08:56.54,00:08:59.57
I need to relax, okay?[br]I was working all day.

00:09:00.34,00:09:03.30
And you don't think[br]taking care of our chick is work?

00:09:05.94,00:09:08.33
That's not what I said.[br]I just meant--

00:09:08.58,00:09:11.09
I know what you meant!

00:09:16.98,00:09:19.70
Did you notice that ever since[br]we got this chick. . .

00:09:20.18,00:09:22.90
. . .we've been fighting[br]a lot more than we used to?

00:09:24.90,00:09:27.70
I don't know, maybe we weren't[br]ready to have a chick.

00:09:29.58,00:09:31.49
I'll take her back tomorrow.

00:09:32.10,00:09:33.45
We'll get our $3 back?

00:09:39.02,00:09:42.09
I have that Tv thing in two hours,[br]and I need your help.

00:09:42.30,00:09:46.26
What do you think?[br]This blue suit or this brown one?

00:09:46.58,00:09:48.41
The brown one brings out your eyes.

00:09:48.62,00:09:51.50
But your butt looks great[br]in the blue one.

00:09:52.74,00:09:53.93
Really?

00:10:07.66,00:10:10.30
That aspirin dance really works.

00:10:13.10,00:10:15.41
-Is that still. . .?[br]-I'm fine.

00:10:15.66,00:10:17.45
-No, you're not![br]-Yes, I am.

00:10:17.70,00:10:20.29
Look, I'm fine.[br]Watch. Look at that.

00:10:22.02,00:10:24.74
You've got to go to a doctor, okay?

00:10:24.98,00:10:27.81
I have to get ready and go[br]to a dinner at my boss's house.

00:10:28.06,00:10:30.17
There's people there[br]that I have to meet.

00:10:30.42,00:10:33.33
I'm sure you'll make a great[br]impression. "Hi, I'm Rachel.

00:10:33.58,00:10:35.09
It's nice to meet you. "

00:10:36.50,00:10:38.25
Come on, you probably[br]have a broken rib.

00:10:38.50,00:10:41.65
I'll go to the hospital tomorrow.[br]It'll still be broken then.

00:10:41.86,00:10:44.09
But you know, I could use a hand[br]getting ready.

00:10:44.34,00:10:46.41
Either help me, or go.

00:10:46.66,00:10:47.93
Fine. I'll go.

00:10:49.38,00:10:51.61
But before you go,[br]could you help me first?

00:10:55.30,00:10:57.29
Sure. I'll help you.

00:10:58.22,00:11:01.45
Good! Do you guys know how[br]to get a chick out of a vCR?

00:11:10.38,00:11:14.61
You know what?[br]I cannot do this with my left hand.

00:11:14.86,00:11:17.21
Would you please help me[br]with this too?

00:11:25.10,00:11:26.82
Let's use this brush.

00:11:27.66,00:11:29.14
-This stuff?[br]-Careful.

00:11:29.38,00:11:30.25
Light.

00:11:30.50,00:11:34.62
Just sweep it across the lid.[br]Just sweep it.

00:11:35.30,00:11:36.45
Sorry!

00:11:37.14,00:11:38.57
That's just poking me in the eye.

00:11:38.78,00:11:40.01
I'm sorry. Close. . . .

00:11:40.26,00:11:42.13
-Just sweep it.[br]-I'm sweeping.

00:11:42.54,00:11:44.33
Sweep, sweep. . . .

00:11:44.78,00:11:46.77
Now make it even,[br]because we don't. . . .

00:11:47.22,00:11:49.86
I don't want it to be too much.[br]I want it to be subtle.

00:11:50.10,00:11:52.98
You don't wear enough of this.

00:11:57.14,00:12:00.81
Since when do you think[br]I don't wear enough of this?

00:12:01.06,00:12:03.53
Close your eye.[br]You're gonna like this better. . . .

00:12:05.26,00:12:07.17
-Close, close.[br]-Blow it.

00:12:08.38,00:12:11.73
Because I think this will make you[br]a little more sophisticated.

00:12:12.30,00:12:14.21
Sophisticated like a hooker?

00:12:18.22,00:12:19.97
-Guess what I'm doing tonight.[br]-What?

00:12:20.18,00:12:22.01
I'm checking out[br]the restaurant with Pete.

00:12:22.26,00:12:24.53
Monica, I am so excited for you!

00:12:25.86,00:12:27.18
I have to tell you something.

00:12:27.50,00:12:28.29
What?

00:12:28.54,00:12:29.94
I can't tell you.

00:12:31.50,00:12:34.89
Wouldn't it be easier to tell[br]me something that you could tell me?

00:12:35.14,00:12:37.09
Well, sure, in a perfect world.

00:12:38.86,00:12:42.49
But no. I promised I wouldn't tell,[br]and I swore to all my Gods.

00:12:45.58,00:12:47.61
Does it have to do with[br]Ross and Rachel?

00:12:48.62,00:12:49.81
Does it have to do with Joey?

00:12:50.94,00:12:54.33
Does it have to do with Chandler[br]and that sock he keeps by his bed?

00:12:56.54,00:12:58.33
No, but let's come back to that later.

00:13:02.38,00:13:05.73
There you go![br]Good enough for your party?

00:13:11.54,00:13:12.73
Sure.

00:13:13.46,00:13:17.61
Sure. I'll just sit next to[br]the transsexual from purchasing.

00:13:22.06,00:13:25.21
All right, I gotta go,[br]So good luck at the party.

00:13:25.46,00:13:28.21
Could you just stay[br]and help me get dressed?

00:13:30.58,00:13:31.90
Sure.

00:13:32.66,00:13:35.97
Great. Okay, just turn around.

00:13:36.38,00:13:37.29
What?

00:13:37.54,00:13:39.45
I don't want you to see me naked.

00:13:39.70,00:13:43.41
I've seen you naked a million times.[br]I ate hot fudge off you naked.

00:13:43.66,00:13:46.65
I sucked that mini-marshmallow[br]out of your bellybutton.

00:13:47.98,00:13:50.49
Yeah, but that was different.[br]We were going out then.

00:13:50.74,00:13:52.33
Now it's weird.

00:13:52.58,00:13:55.97
Rach, you know, I can see[br]you naked anytime I want.

00:13:56.58,00:13:57.53
What?

00:13:58.34,00:14:02.09
All I have to do is close my eyes.[br]See?

00:14:05.46,00:14:08.05
Ross, stop that!

00:14:08.98,00:14:11.45
Come on! Don't think of me[br]like that anymore.

00:14:11.70,00:14:13.34
Sorry. Nothing you can do about it.

00:14:13.58,00:14:16.01
It's one of my rights[br]as the ex-boyfriend.

00:14:19.06,00:14:22.25
Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!

00:14:22.50,00:14:24.53
I'm sorry. It will never happen--

00:14:24.78,00:14:26.13
Wait a minute! Wait, wait. . . .

00:14:26.38,00:14:29.49
Now there are 1 00 of you,[br]and I'm the king!

00:14:32.58,00:14:34.33
Would you grow up? It's no big deal.

00:14:35.86,00:14:38.37
All right. Fine.

00:14:42.50,00:14:45.46
See what you did?[br]I'm gonna be doing it by myself now.

00:14:46.90,00:14:49.37
Oh, my God. All right, look, look. . . .

00:14:50.26,00:14:53.37
Easy. Easy.[br]You have to go to the hospital, okay?

00:14:53.62,00:14:55.34
I do. I really do.

00:14:55.58,00:14:57.97
I'll get your coat,[br]then I'll put you in a cab.

00:14:58.22,00:14:59.89
You're not gonna come with me?

00:15:03.38,00:15:05.49
Of course I am.

00:15:05.70,00:15:07.49
I just have to make a call.

00:15:08.58,00:15:09.81
Thank you.

00:15:15.66,00:15:16.65
What's wrong?

00:15:16.90,00:15:20.29
I'm sorry. I just can't go[br]to the hospital looking like this.

00:15:21.58,00:15:23.57
Does it involve travel?

00:15:23.86,00:15:25.93
Does it involve clogs?

00:15:26.18,00:15:28.53
Clogs or claws?

00:15:28.98,00:15:29.81
Clogs.

00:15:30.58,00:15:32.06
Claws?

00:15:34.74,00:15:38.45
So it doesn't involve Ross or Rachel[br]or Chandler or Joey.

00:15:38.94,00:15:39.97
What about Pete?

00:15:41.10,00:15:42.69
What is it?

00:15:43.46,00:15:46.05
-What about Pete?[br]-I don't know!

00:15:47.50,00:15:48.93
I feel like I'm talking to Lassie.

00:15:50.94,00:15:54.33
-Phoebe, would you just tell me?[br]-I can't!

00:15:54.58,00:15:57.33
-I gotta go.[br]-But you're so close!

00:15:57.58,00:15:59.37
Something to do[br]with Pete's company?

00:15:59.62,00:16:01.10
Go! You'll never get it!

00:16:10.38,00:16:11.57
I know.

00:16:13.26,00:16:15.33
See, yes. That's Yasmine Bleeth.

00:16:15.54,00:16:18.21
She's a completely different[br]kind of chick.

00:16:22.06,00:16:23.89
I love you both.

00:16:25.06,00:16:27.53
But in very different ways.

00:16:32.42,00:16:35.09
What are you doing?[br]You were gonna take her back.

00:16:35.30,00:16:37.13
I did. But the store[br]wouldn't take her back.

00:16:37.38,00:16:40.49
Then I took her to the shelter.[br]You know what I found out?

00:16:46.26,00:16:49.49
If they can't find a home for her,[br]they kill her!

00:16:49.90,00:16:52.05
I won't let that happen[br]to little Jasmine.

00:16:54.34,00:16:58.54
Good, good, because I was[br]kind of having second thoughts too.

00:16:58.78,00:17:01.97
And it's not just chicks.[br]It's all kinds of other animals.

00:17:02.22,00:17:04.61
That's horrible.[br]You did the right thing.

00:17:04.86,00:17:07.74
Thanks. I'm glad[br]you see it that way.

00:17:18.78,00:17:20.29
Funny story!

00:17:22.90,00:17:24.85
I don't believe this!

00:17:25.10,00:17:28.29
Look at this refrigerator![br]It's gigantic!

00:17:28.54,00:17:32.09
I could live in this thing![br]I'd be cold, but I'm always cold!

00:17:33.78,00:17:37.05
Oh, my God! Look at these spider[br]burners! I love spider burners!

00:17:37.30,00:17:38.65
So you like it?

00:17:38.90,00:17:42.49
It is so perfect![br]Thank you so much.

00:17:42.70,00:17:44.13
You're welcome.

00:17:50.54,00:17:51.94
Did you just smell my hair?

00:17:53.10,00:17:55.29
No! No way! What?

00:17:56.10,00:17:57.82
-Oh, God.[br]-What?

00:17:59.50,00:18:01.25
You still have feelings for me.

00:18:01.50,00:18:05.17
I'm just excited about the restaurant,[br]that's all.

00:18:06.10,00:18:07.50
I love you. Is that so bad?

00:18:09.50,00:18:11.69
No, it's not bad.[br]It's not bad at all.

00:18:11.90,00:18:13.69
It's really nice.

00:18:14.14,00:18:17.73
The only one who stands to get hurt[br]is me, and I'm okay with that.

00:18:18.82,00:18:20.33
You may be okay with getting hurt. . .

00:18:20.58,00:18:23.69
. . .but I am not okay with being[br]the one who hurts you.

00:18:25.46,00:18:27.13
That's why I can't take this job.

00:18:27.38,00:18:28.49
What?

00:18:29.78,00:18:32.42
We probably shouldn't[br]see each other anymore.

00:18:33.38,00:18:34.70
I'm sorry.

00:18:37.22,00:18:41.05
I mean, if that's[br]really what you want, okay.

00:18:51.06,00:18:52.01
I'm sorry things--

00:18:52.22,00:18:56.10
Shut up for a second[br]and let me just see something.

00:19:09.78,00:19:11.13
You'd tell me the truth?

00:19:11.38,00:19:14.65
Rach, you can't look fat in an x-ray.

00:19:16.58,00:19:20.89
Now you stay out here[br]and you think about what you did!

00:19:22.54,00:19:24.97
-That's a duck![br]-That's a bad duck!

00:19:27.78,00:19:30.09
How'd the thing go tonight, Ross?

00:19:31.50,00:19:32.73
What thing? What thing?

00:19:32.98,00:19:35.89
Nothing. There was this thing[br]at the museum. Come on.

00:19:36.14,00:19:37.17
Easy.

00:19:38.82,00:19:43.10
Now, when you come back, I hope you[br]remember that that chick is not a toy!

00:19:47.14,00:19:48.93
What "thing"? What is this "thing"?

00:19:49.18,00:19:53.33
I was kind of supposed to be on Tv[br]tonight for the Discovery Channel.

00:19:53.86,00:19:55.65
Oh, my God!

00:19:55.90,00:19:57.57
Ross, why didn't you tell me that?

00:19:57.82,00:20:00.41
I knew that if I told you,[br]you'd make me go. . .

00:20:00.66,00:20:04.54
. . .and I knew you needed someone[br]to be with you tonight. Come on.

00:20:05.38,00:20:07.61
-I cannot believe you.[br]-What?

00:20:07.86,00:20:10.69
That is the sweetest thing.

00:20:20.58,00:20:22.01
You should get some sleep.

00:20:24.98,00:20:26.54
Sorry I spoiled your evening.

00:20:26.78,00:20:28.89
As long as you're okay.

00:20:29.10,00:20:32.06
So I'll see you tomorrow.

00:20:40.78,00:20:42.01
See you.

00:20:54.18,00:20:55.45
What did you do?

00:21:06.26,00:21:07.25
What you doing?

00:21:07.46,00:21:09.25
Having a swim.

00:21:09.78,00:21:11.69
What about the chick?

00:21:12.06,00:21:13.49
Chicks don't swim.

00:21:13.70,00:21:15.13
Are you sure?

00:21:16.94,00:21:18.50
I don't know.

00:21:19.82,00:21:21.61
-Should we try?[br]-Sure.

00:21:29.18,00:21:31.69
See, I told you.[br]They don't swim.

00:21:32.38,00:21:34.02
Well, give him a minute.

00:21:35.98,00:21:39.69
It's okay.[br]It's okay, baby, baby, baby.
