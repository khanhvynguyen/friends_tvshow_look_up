00:00:03.06,00:00:04.49
Are you still on hold?

00:00:04.70,00:00:07.00
I was supposed to call my dad back[br]two hours ago.

00:00:07.26,00:00:08.69
Oh, yeah. He clicked on.

00:00:08.94,00:00:11.81
Call him as soon as you get a chance.[br]He's at Flimbees.

00:00:12.34,00:00:13.21
What's Flimbees?

00:00:13.42,00:00:16.29
That's the word I use when[br]I can't remember the real thing.

00:00:17.86,00:00:20.09
Okay, hang up! That's it. Come on!

00:00:20.30,00:00:22.33
No. That's what they want me to do.

00:00:22.58,00:00:25.09
My warranty expires tomorrow.[br]If I don't get through. . .

00:00:25.30,00:00:27.89
. . .they won't fix my crappy,[br]broken phone for free!

00:00:28.10,00:00:30.13
We cannot let them win![br]It's us versus them!

00:00:30.38,00:00:31.69
Yes!

00:00:35.26,00:00:38.29
I gotta double-check for tickets[br]tonight. Who got what?

00:00:38.54,00:00:39.49
I have one.

00:00:39.74,00:00:42.04
I need two. I'm bringing Pete.

00:00:42.38,00:00:43.57
My boyfriend.

00:00:45.54,00:00:47.57
I have a boyfriend now.

00:00:47.98,00:00:49.49
Two it is. How about you?

00:00:50.78,00:00:52.61
Yeah, I also need two.

00:00:53.38,00:00:55.13
Really? Who's number two?

00:00:55.38,00:00:59.69
Whose Number Two? One of the more[br]difficult games sewer workers play.

00:01:01.58,00:01:03.61
No, it's just this person.

00:01:03.98,00:01:05.57
Like a date-type person?

00:01:05.90,00:01:08.49
Yeah, kind of.[br]It's this woman from work.

00:01:08.74,00:01:11.49
I hope that won't be too weird.[br]Will it, Rach?

00:01:12.78,00:01:15.73
Not at all. I was actually[br]gonna bring someone myself.

00:01:16.14,00:01:18.13
But you said one ticket.

00:01:21.26,00:01:23.61
I meant me plus one.

00:01:24.14,00:01:26.65
Okay. Did you guys mean you plus one?

00:01:28.78,00:01:30.53
All right. I'll see you tonight.

00:01:30.78,00:01:31.69
Okay. Bye-bye.

00:01:31.94,00:01:32.85
Bye-bye.

00:01:33.74,00:01:34.85
Okay, I need a date!

00:01:36.78,00:01:40.09
Oh, hey! You guys are finally[br]gonna get to meet Kate!

00:01:40.30,00:01:42.76
And I borrowed your cologne.[br]I hope she likes it.

00:01:42.98,00:01:45.54
What are you doing?[br]She's seeing somebody.

00:01:45.78,00:01:47.97
Yeah, and I don't have any cologne.

00:01:48.78,00:01:52.21
-Bottle next to the shaving cream.[br]-Worm medicine for the duck.

00:01:54.18,00:01:56.33

00:02:42.46,00:02:44.89
-Here you go. You can wear this.[br]-Thanks.

00:02:48.42,00:02:50.17
I'm setting the phone down.

00:02:51.34,00:02:52.65
But I'm still here.

00:02:53.66,00:02:55.89
Just don't go anywhere.[br]I'm still here.

00:02:56.34,00:03:00.25
Don't switch or anything, because[br]I'm right here. Just one sec.

00:03:01.66,00:03:03.65
One sec. One second!

00:03:04.14,00:03:06.25
Wait! One second! Just. . . .

00:03:06.94,00:03:08.85
What? Monica, I'm scared!

00:03:09.86,00:03:11.97
Honey, that's a sleeve.

00:03:13.14,00:03:15.60
And we also have a speakerphone.

00:03:15.86,00:03:18.93
Please stay on the line.[br]Your call is important to us.

00:03:19.18,00:03:21.09
You gotta hang up.[br]We'll be late.

00:03:21.30,00:03:23.89
Thank you for your patience.[br]You're the next caller.

00:03:24.14,00:03:26.44
Yes! Yes! I'm the next caller!

00:03:26.94,00:03:29.29
You were gonna have me hang up.

00:03:32.78,00:03:34.93
Can you take a duck and a chick[br]to the theater?

00:03:36.30,00:03:37.61
Of course not.

00:03:37.94,00:03:40.61
I just wanted them to hear it[br]from somebody else.

00:03:48.90,00:03:50.49
Oh, hi, how are you?

00:03:50.74,00:03:51.77
Good.

00:03:53.54,00:03:56.33
-Looks like we're the first ones here.[br]-Looks that way.

00:03:56.58,00:03:57.69
First ones here!

00:04:01.18,00:04:03.69
Oh, Tommy, this is Ross.[br]Ross, Tommy.

00:04:03.90,00:04:06.09
Oh, I'm sorry. This is Cailin.[br]Cailin--

00:04:06.34,00:04:07.25
Sorry.

00:04:07.86,00:04:08.89
And break!

00:04:12.98,00:04:15.36
I think I'm gonna run[br]to the ladies' room.

00:04:15.58,00:04:17.69
-I'll join you.[br]-I'll get our seats.

00:04:19.98,00:04:21.37
Well, this is. . .

00:04:21.62,00:04:22.68
. . .awkward.

00:04:24.30,00:04:26.89
Well, because Rachel and I[br]used to go out.

00:04:27.14,00:04:28.73
Oh, I didn't know that.

00:04:30.94,00:04:33.53
Well, then this is awkward.

00:04:35.18,00:04:37.64
-So what do you. . .?[br]-I think we're here.

00:04:39.90,00:04:41.69
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

00:04:41.90,00:04:44.01
I think you may be in our seats.

00:04:45.78,00:04:47.25
No, I don't think so.

00:04:47.46,00:04:49.89
-Could we take a look at your ticket?[br]-Sure.

00:04:51.78,00:04:54.41
Yeah. Yeah, see, this says, "D-1 3" . . . .

00:04:55.54,00:04:57.09
Oh, well, I thought that--

00:04:57.30,00:05:00.81
You thought? Well, that didn't[br]really work out for you. Idiot!

00:05:02.50,00:05:05.85
What are you, a moron?[br]It says, "D-1 3" ! Okay?

00:05:06.18,00:05:09.09
You're surrounded by even numbers![br]Does that give you a clue?

00:05:09.58,00:05:12.21
-The usher told me--[br]-The usher must be right!

00:05:12.46,00:05:14.09
With all his training!

00:05:14.54,00:05:15.60
Get out!

00:05:16.58,00:05:17.45
Here!

00:05:21.06,00:05:23.49
-Hey, man, you want the aisle?[br]-No, I'm good.

00:05:35.26,00:05:37.13
-There he is![br]-There's our star!

00:05:37.38,00:05:38.89
You were great!

00:05:39.10,00:05:40.29
So? What'd you think?

00:05:40.58,00:05:44.28
Almost as good as the play with[br]the two naked girls on the seesaw.

00:05:45.18,00:05:47.09
-I wasn't in that.[br]-I know.

00:05:48.06,00:05:51.13
I want you to meet everybody.[br]Everybody, this is Kate.

00:05:51.38,00:05:53.68
Excuse me. Excuse me.[br]Sweetheart!

00:05:56.54,00:05:57.49
Come!

00:06:01.14,00:06:03.29
So that's the girl you like.

00:06:05.38,00:06:07.94
I tell you, this guy[br]Rachel is with is crazy.

00:06:08.18,00:06:12.77
He viciously screamed at total[br]strangers. I think he's bad news.

00:06:14.26,00:06:17.65
Wait a minute. You don't like[br]the guy Rachel's dating?

00:06:18.06,00:06:19.12
Well, that's odd.

00:06:20.62,00:06:24.53
Oh, hey, Lauren. You guys, this is[br]Kate's understudy, Lauren.

00:06:24.78,00:06:26.69
Hey, gosh, you look so familiar.

00:06:26.94,00:06:29.53
I ran into you in the hallway[br]in your building.

00:06:29.78,00:06:33.48
It was right after I slept with Joey.[br]He dumped me the next day.

00:06:35.18,00:06:37.05
So how'd you guys meet?

00:06:37.90,00:06:41.13
The short version is, I pursued[br]her for a couple of months.

00:06:41.38,00:06:44.33
Then I gave her a check for $20,000[br]and she was mine.

00:06:45.98,00:06:50.29
In the long version, I dump him[br]for telling people the short version.

00:06:51.06,00:06:53.41
Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous!

00:06:54.98,00:06:56.93
You guys, this is my agent, Estelle.

00:06:57.18,00:06:58.29
How do you do?

00:06:58.50,00:07:01.45
Oh, you two girls were outstanding!

00:07:01.98,00:07:03.97
Do they have representation?

00:07:04.90,00:07:06.57
They weren't in the play.

00:07:06.90,00:07:08.12
We're not actors.

00:07:08.46,00:07:09.33
What a shame!

00:07:09.78,00:07:13.73
With her face and her chest,[br]I could really put something together.

00:07:15.90,00:07:17.21
Could I borrow it?

00:07:19.58,00:07:21.33
Hi. Remember me?

00:07:22.06,00:07:24.62
Hi. Yeah. Tommy's in line[br]for the bathroom. . .

00:07:24.86,00:07:27.77
. . .and someone just cut.[br]I think he's gonna snap.

00:07:29.30,00:07:30.49
I'm gonna go.

00:07:30.86,00:07:32.08
Go? Why?

00:07:32.30,00:07:34.97
I don't know. Could be[br]because I don't feel like. . .

00:07:35.22,00:07:38.21
. . .waiting all night for a guy[br]who may or may not scream.

00:07:40.70,00:07:42.73
He definitely will scream.

00:07:43.98,00:07:45.09
Goodbye.

00:07:49.14,00:07:50.69
Here we go, people!

00:07:56.98,00:07:58.37
"Boxing Day.

00:07:59.30,00:08:01.17
The Lucille Lortel Theatre. . . .

00:08:03.18,00:08:07.65
Joey Tribbiani gives[br]an uneven performance.

00:08:08.14,00:08:11.21
But Mr. Tribbiani is not the worst[br]thing in this production. "

00:08:11.46,00:08:12.41
Yes!

00:08:15.98,00:08:20.21
"Kate Miller's awkward and mannered[br]portrayal is laughable. "

00:08:21.50,00:08:23.61
Here it is! "The direction. . .

00:08:23.86,00:08:26.97
. . .by Marshall Townend is. . . . "

00:08:32.98,00:08:34.53
Thank you, boys and girls.

00:08:34.78,00:08:37.29
You've ruined my life.

00:08:37.58,00:08:40.89
Please stuff your talentless faces. . .

00:08:41.10,00:08:43.45
. . .with my mother's crab cakes!

00:08:44.26,00:08:45.48
Excuse me!

00:08:51.06,00:08:52.93
Does anyone mind if I save this?

00:08:58.26,00:09:00.05
-Is the play over?[br]-Where were you?

00:09:00.58,00:09:04.09
Thank you for your patience.[br]You're the next caller.

00:09:04.50,00:09:07.89
You were "the next caller" hours ago.[br]You must be going crazy.

00:09:08.14,00:09:10.21
I've kept myself busy.

00:09:18.30,00:09:22.29
Okay, yeah, I put your stuff in[br]her room and her stuff in your room.

00:09:28.30,00:09:29.13
You okay?

00:09:30.50,00:09:31.37
Fabulous.

00:09:31.70,00:09:36.33
Drama critics, they're nothing but[br]people who couldn't make it as actors.

00:09:36.58,00:09:38.81
-You know what to do?[br]-Become a drama critic.

00:09:43.58,00:09:44.89
I am hurt!

00:09:47.78,00:09:49.09
A plague. . .

00:09:49.46,00:09:51.57
. . .on both your houses!

00:09:54.06,00:09:57.49
By the way, he dumped me tonight[br]after he read my review.

00:09:57.70,00:09:59.41
Oh, classy.

00:10:01.50,00:10:03.33
I sure know how to pick them.

00:10:04.94,00:10:07.89
You know I gave up a part[br]on a soap for this?

00:10:10.30,00:10:11.57
I gave up a job too.

00:10:11.98,00:10:14.81
-Really? What?[br]-Declawing cats.

00:10:16.78,00:10:19.34
Hey, tell you what,[br]let me walk you home.

00:10:19.58,00:10:23.57
We'll stop by every newsstand and burn[br]every copy of The Times and The Post.

00:10:23.86,00:10:26.01
-Why The Post?[br]-You didn't see The Post?

00:10:26.26,00:10:28.93
-No. You?[br]-No. Why?

00:10:36.10,00:10:38.89
You really think these newspapers[br]are just jealous of me?

00:10:39.10,00:10:42.25
Absolutely. You're talented[br]and you're good-looking.

00:10:42.74,00:10:45.12
You're sweet and cute.

00:10:45.38,00:10:47.68
I know. That's why they trashed me.

00:10:54.66,00:10:56.65
-Wait. Wait a minute.[br]-What?

00:10:58.58,00:11:00.29
I don't get you.

00:11:00.50,00:11:02.37
I mean, first you hate me.

00:11:02.66,00:11:05.17
Then you sleep with me.

00:11:05.58,00:11:08.33
Then you want nothing to do with me.[br]Now you want me again?

00:11:08.58,00:11:11.04
You never went out[br]with an actress before?

00:11:12.50,00:11:15.09
Kate, do you even like me?

00:11:17.86,00:11:21.29
-Of course I do.[br]-So how come you blew me off?

00:11:21.54,00:11:24.81
-How come you were with him?[br]-I don't know.

00:11:25.46,00:11:27.13
I just do this.

00:11:27.66,00:11:30.53
I always have to pick, like,[br]the smartest guy. . .

00:11:30.78,00:11:32.29
. . .or the most talented guy.

00:11:33.58,00:11:35.88
Why can't I just[br]pick someone like you?

00:11:38.98,00:11:40.04
Thanks.

00:11:42.34,00:11:43.81
You know what I mean.

00:11:45.70,00:11:47.97
I mean, like, the sweetest guy.

00:11:49.46,00:11:51.01
You're just so. . . .

00:11:52.30,00:11:53.41
You're so. . .

00:11:54.70,00:11:55.61
: : :so: : : :

00:12:06.98,00:12:09.54
Here we go.[br]Let's get your feet up there.

00:12:17.06,00:12:18.41
Good night.

00:12:19.54,00:12:20.85
Sweet dreams.

00:12:27.38,00:12:30.69
I'm gonna put this can right here[br]in case you have to hurl.

00:12:38.78,00:12:42.69
Please stay on the line.[br]Your call is very important to us.

00:12:43.74,00:12:46.93
You've been up for 24 hours.[br]Go to sleep.

00:12:47.18,00:12:48.29
This isn't healthy.

00:12:48.50,00:12:50.09
No, no, I'm fine.

00:12:50.30,00:12:53.61
And you know why?[br]Because of all the riboflavin.

00:12:58.82,00:13:00.73
Didn't you have that on last night?

00:13:01.54,00:13:03.45
I stayed at Kate's[br]but nothing happened.

00:13:04.58,00:13:06.01
Hey, where were you?

00:13:06.26,00:13:09.88
I'm so, so sorry.[br]I am definitely gonna see your play.

00:13:10.10,00:13:13.33
I swear, your play is very important[br]to us. Thank you for your patience.

00:13:13.58,00:13:16.37
Your play is the next play[br]I'm gonna see.

00:13:18.18,00:13:19.49
How'd it go with Kate?

00:13:19.70,00:13:20.49
It was great!

00:13:20.70,00:13:25.21
I walked her home, and it was[br]amazing how much we connected.

00:13:25.46,00:13:26.81
Then she passed out.

00:13:27.06,00:13:28.73
But then she woke up.

00:13:28.98,00:13:31.28
And we stayed up all night talking.

00:13:31.50,00:13:33.57
And now we're crazy about each other!

00:13:35.18,00:13:36.53
You had "the night" !

00:13:37.58,00:13:40.49
When two people realize[br]their feelings for each other. . .

00:13:40.70,00:13:44.09
. . .and they talk for hours and learn[br]all about the other person.

00:13:44.30,00:13:45.28
You think?

00:13:45.54,00:13:48.29
-Did you learn about her family?[br]-Two brothers. One died!

00:13:48.54,00:13:49.37
Yes!

00:13:56.38,00:13:58.29
This is from the woman at the bar.

00:14:02.86,00:14:05.49
Sorry. She thought[br]you were somebody else.

00:14:08.98,00:14:10.33
-What time is it?[br]-One.

00:14:10.58,00:14:11.97
7: 1 5.

00:14:12.98,00:14:14.33
Watch doesn't work.

00:14:15.58,00:14:18.69
Tommy's supposed to be here soon.[br]We're going to lunch.

00:14:21.06,00:14:24.76
Look, I wasn't gonna[br]say anything to you, but. . . .

00:14:24.98,00:14:28.49
All right, I don't think[br]you should be seeing Tommy anymore.

00:14:29.54,00:14:30.76
You don't?

00:14:30.98,00:14:35.13
The guy is mean. I mean, really mean.[br]I think you should stay away from him.

00:14:36.26,00:14:39.49
Or maybe I should stay away[br]from all men.

00:14:39.90,00:14:42.09
It's not just because I'm jealous.

00:14:43.70,00:14:46.05
I mean, I'm not. I'm not jealous.

00:14:46.66,00:14:50.97
Look, the guy actually screamed[br]at this couple sitting in our seats.

00:14:51.22,00:14:53.49
Yeah, and at the end of the play. . .

00:14:53.90,00:14:58.49
. . .he got up, and he just started,[br]like, banging his hands together.

00:15:00.86,00:15:03.29
You don't want to believe me,[br]that's fine.

00:15:03.54,00:15:04.65
We're kidding.

00:15:07.38,00:15:10.33
No one believe me.[br]I'm Mr. Funny to you. Mr. Funny!

00:15:10.66,00:15:13.45
-Sorry, Tommy.[br]-What's in the cup?

00:15:15.02,00:15:17.09
What is in the cup?

00:15:17.30,00:15:18.36
Okay, it's coffee.

00:15:18.58,00:15:20.77
Iced coffee?[br]Tell me it's iced coffee.

00:15:22.38,00:15:24.81
-It's hot--[br]-Hot coffee!

00:15:25.38,00:15:28.73
You idiot! You gonna spill[br]hot coffee all over me, huh?

00:15:28.98,00:15:33.25
What are you? Just a big, stupid[br]doofy idiot with a doofy idiot hairdo?

00:15:37.58,00:15:39.88
What's your favorite thing[br]about summertime?

00:15:40.14,00:15:43.97
Going to the beach[br]when it stays light real late.

00:15:48.74,00:15:50.81
What's your favorite thing[br]about summer?

00:15:51.78,00:15:54.81
I don't know. Probably the smell[br]of freshly cut grass.

00:15:55.18,00:15:56.77
That's a good one.

00:16:01.38,00:16:05.33
Sorry! Sorry I'm late! My duck and[br]my chick had a fight. It was ugly.

00:16:05.90,00:16:08.09
We held the curtain for you.[br]Let's go!

00:16:13.34,00:16:16.21
vic! Where have you been, baby?

00:16:20.38,00:16:21.25
Where's Kate?

00:16:21.50,00:16:22.81
She got a job in L.A.

00:16:25.58,00:16:30.21
I've been waiting up all night[br]for you. Where have you been?

00:16:31.10,00:16:33.37
Where have you been, vic?

00:16:35.30,00:16:39.08
Go to the window. I wanna run down[br]to the truck and show you something.

00:16:41.38,00:16:43.65
What do you got down there, vic?

00:16:43.90,00:16:46.28
What do you got under that tarp?

00:16:49.30,00:16:50.33
When is she leaving?

00:16:50.66,00:16:53.17
Tonight. What are you doing?

00:16:54.74,00:16:55.93
I'm coming up!

00:16:59.14,00:17:01.29
Hey, you mind if I use the phone?

00:17:06.38,00:17:08.94
Use ours across the hall[br]because she. . .

00:17:09.18,00:17:10.49
. . .has problems.

00:17:10.74,00:17:11.69
Thanks.

00:17:14.74,00:17:15.53
Sorry, Tommy.

00:17:15.78,00:17:18.45
I almost spilled this[br]hot coffee on you.

00:17:19.50,00:17:21.09
Yeah, but you didn't.

00:17:21.34,00:17:22.48
No, but. . .

00:17:23.06,00:17:24.20
. . .it's hot.

00:17:27.86,00:17:30.29
Would you stop it?[br]It's getting really old.

00:17:30.54,00:17:32.41
I can't believe no one believes me.

00:17:32.78,00:17:34.17
I do. I believe you.

00:17:34.74,00:17:35.57
You do?

00:17:35.82,00:17:39.01
Yeah. But I also believed her[br]when she said I was next.

00:17:46.74,00:17:48.21
Hey there, little fella.

00:17:48.50,00:17:50.69
Mr. Fuzzy Man, how you doing?

00:17:54.90,00:17:55.81
Gross!

00:17:56.50,00:17:57.29
Idiot!

00:17:58.34,00:18:01.13
Stupid, little, fuzzy, yellow creature!

00:18:01.38,00:18:05.13
"Oh, look at me! I'm so cute![br]I'm a little chick who's disgusting! "

00:18:05.38,00:18:07.76
You're so stupid![br]How are you not yet extinct?

00:18:10.78,00:18:12.45
What are you quacking about?

00:18:12.86,00:18:14.41
Dumb Donald Dodo!

00:18:18.38,00:18:20.65
Step away from the duck.

00:18:23.94,00:18:25.89
Sorry, little Mr. Chickadee.

00:18:26.10,00:18:28.05
Sorry you went doody in my hand!

00:18:30.98,00:18:33.01
I guess we're not going out anymore.

00:18:33.26,00:18:34.24
Man!

00:18:38.54,00:18:42.13
Joey, I'm so glad I caught you.[br]I couldn't find you before.

00:18:42.54,00:18:44.37
What's all this about L.A.?

00:18:44.70,00:18:46.53
They still want me[br]for General Hospital.

00:18:46.74,00:18:47.57
But. . .

00:18:48.10,00:18:49.41
. . .what about us?

00:18:50.74,00:18:52.69
Last night was wonderful.

00:18:53.70,00:18:55.69
But I can't stay here just for you.

00:18:56.78,00:18:58.65
So stay for the museums.

00:18:59.50,00:19:01.65
-I'm sorry.[br]-Joey, on-stage!

00:19:02.34,00:19:04.33
At least stay till the end[br]of the play.

00:19:04.58,00:19:07.29
I'll go to the airport with you.[br]I want to say goodbye.

00:19:07.54,00:19:08.89
Where are you, vic?

00:19:09.38,00:19:11.57
Flight's in an hour.[br]I gotta go.

00:19:11.78,00:19:13.09
vic?

00:19:13.34,00:19:14.25
vic?

00:19:15.74,00:19:17.49
-vic![br]-In a minute!

00:19:19.98,00:19:22.25
So this is it, victor?

00:19:23.14,00:19:25.25
Yeah. I guess it is.

00:19:31.98,00:19:32.96
Listen. . .

00:19:34.78,00:19:38.37
. . .I gotta say goodbye, and I gotta say[br]it quick because this is killing me.

00:19:38.98,00:19:43.37
One thing you gotta know[br]is that I will never forget you.

00:19:43.62,00:19:46.33
But you got things[br]you have to do now.

00:19:46.98,00:19:48.09
And so do l.

00:19:50.18,00:19:51.13
And so. . .

00:19:53.54,00:19:55.89
. . .I'm gonna get on[br]this spaceship. . .

00:20:02.98,00:20:07.09
. . .and I'm gonna go to Blaargon-7[br]in search of alternative fuels.

00:20:07.98,00:20:11.17
But when I return[br]200 years from now. . .

00:20:11.70,00:20:13.81
. . .you'll be long gone. . .

00:20:14.38,00:20:16.33
. . .but I won't have aged at all.

00:20:19.78,00:20:23.09
So you tell your great,[br]great granddaughter. . .

00:20:23.50,00:20:24.69
. . .to look me up.

00:20:26.66,00:20:28.01
Because, Adrianne. . .

00:20:28.78,00:20:29.69
. . .baby. . .

00:20:31.94,00:20:33.89
. . .I'm gonna want to meet her.

00:20:41.42,00:20:43.05
So long, vic!

00:20:50.70,00:20:53.05
It's been two days.

00:20:53.74,00:20:54.77
Yeah, I know.

00:20:55.30,00:20:58.21
Good thing it's one of those[br]801 numbers, right?

00:20:58.42,00:21:03.13
Phoebe, 800 is toll free.[br]801 is Utah.

00:21:05.58,00:21:10.01
It has to be 800 because all those[br]big companies have 800 numbers.

00:21:10.26,00:21:11.17
Every. . . .

00:21:12.14,00:21:15.33
Yeah, every big Utah-based company[br]has one.

00:21:16.66,00:21:19.53
Sorry. I'm so sorry.[br]I will pay you back.

00:21:20.06,00:21:22.69
And yet she's still not[br]hanging up the phone.

00:21:22.90,00:21:24.49
-Hang up![br]-Hang up the phone!

00:21:24.78,00:21:26.13
Fine! Fine!

00:21:33.34,00:21:35.05
Well, I think I broke it.

00:21:37.54,00:21:41.08
But that's all right.[br]Here's the number where you can call.
