00:00:03.51,00:00:06.47
Wouldn't it be cool if our duck[br]and our chick had a baby?

00:00:06.71,00:00:08.74
We could call it Chuck.

00:00:10.35,00:00:11.75
Or Dick.

00:00:15.51,00:00:17.74
Listen, I need a favor.

00:00:18.83,00:00:21.14
I was in the shower,[br]and as I was. . .

00:00:21.39,00:00:24.86
. . .cleansing myself, I felt something.

00:00:25.07,00:00:27.95
Was it like a sneeze, only better?

00:00:29.99,00:00:32.18
No. I mean, like,[br]a thing on my body.

00:00:32.83,00:00:33.98
Well, what was it?

00:00:34.19,00:00:37.66
Well, I don't know.[br]It's kind of in a place that's not. . . .

00:00:37.91,00:00:41.79
It's not visually accessible to me.[br]And I was hoping maybe you guys. . .

00:00:42.03,00:00:43.18
. . .could help me out.

00:00:45.91,00:00:47.94
Come on, you guys![br]It's no big deal!

00:00:52.11,00:00:54.75
Well, what is it?[br]ls it a mole?

00:00:56.39,00:00:58.95
No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.

00:00:59.19,00:01:00.94
Is it--?[br]What, a pimple?

00:01:04.23,00:01:05.34
No, it's. . .

00:01:05.91,00:01:07.79
. . .fancier than a pimple.

00:01:08.03,00:01:10.22
-Ross, just go see a doc--[br]-Guys, what's--?

00:01:15.63,00:01:18.38
Well, it's definite.[br]Two more weeks of winter.

00:01:18.59,00:01:19.38
Yeah, right.

00:01:20.59,00:01:22.54
The One With Ross' Thing

00:02:09.71,00:02:13.18
And this is the coffeehouse.[br]This is where I play my music.

00:02:13.43,00:02:15.38
-Good deal.[br]-These are my friends.

00:02:15.63,00:02:18.62
People? This is vince.[br]vince, the people.

00:02:20.55,00:02:22.03
vince is a fireman.

00:02:23.11,00:02:25.46
Have you ever rescued anyone[br]from a burning building?

00:02:25.67,00:02:27.98
Ninety-eight hot saves.[br]Highest on the force.

00:02:28.19,00:02:32.02
If Joey and I play with matches,[br]we could get you up to an even 1 00.

00:02:34.03,00:02:36.18
Fire safety is not a joke, son.

00:02:38.55,00:02:40.14
You're right. I know.

00:02:41.31,00:02:43.34
Look, I gotta go.[br]I'm on call tonight.

00:02:43.59,00:02:44.58
See you Saturday.

00:02:47.95,00:02:49.06
He's cute, Pheebs.

00:02:49.31,00:02:51.30
But you just started dating[br]that teacher.

00:02:51.51,00:02:52.38
Oh, Jason?

00:02:52.63,00:02:54.38
We're seeing each other tonight.

00:02:54.63,00:02:56.27
Well, Pheebs?

00:02:56.55,00:02:59.11
Two dates in one day?[br]That's so unlike you.

00:02:59.31,00:03:02.38
I know, I know.[br]I'm, like, playing the field.

00:03:02.63,00:03:06.34
I'm juggling two guys.[br]I'm sowing my wild oats.

00:03:06.79,00:03:10.75
You know, this kind of, like,[br]oat-sowing, field-playing juggler.

00:03:11.07,00:03:12.79
So do they know about each other?

00:03:13.39,00:03:15.58
Does a dog's lips move[br]when he reads?

00:03:19.83,00:03:21.74
Okay, no, they don't know.

00:03:23.79,00:03:24.94
Hey, guys.

00:03:28.03,00:03:29.94
-Well?[br]-How'd it go at the doctor's?

00:03:30.15,00:03:33.90
He said there's definitely[br]nothing to worry about. It's benign.

00:03:34.11,00:03:36.18
-What is it?[br]-He couldn't even tell me.

00:03:36.43,00:03:41.34
He said it was just[br]some sort of "skin abnormality. "

00:03:42.15,00:03:45.35
The worse thing is, he said,[br]being unable to identify it. . .

00:03:45.59,00:03:47.39
. . .he was reluctant to remove it.

00:03:47.63,00:03:48.98
You should go to my guy.

00:03:49.23,00:03:51.54
Because when I went in there[br]with my third nipple. . .

00:03:52.71,00:03:54.74
. . .he just lopped it right off.

00:03:55.07,00:03:56.74
So I guess I'm lucky.

00:03:56.99,00:04:00.95
I mean, not as lucky as people[br]who are born with two nipples.

00:04:01.55,00:04:05.34
At least they knew what yours was.[br]You know? Yours had a name.

00:04:06.23,00:04:08.54
Maybe they'll name yours after you.

00:04:09.23,00:04:11.34
You know?[br]They'd call it "The Ross. "

00:04:11.91,00:04:15.54
And then people would be, like,[br]"Oh, he's got a Ross. "

00:04:17.03,00:04:18.75
Yeah, that'd be cool.

00:04:20.79,00:04:22.35
Pete's breaking up with me.

00:04:22.59,00:04:23.38
What?

00:04:24.19,00:04:25.75
I just checked my messages.

00:04:25.99,00:04:29.11
He said that when he gets back,[br]"We need to talk. "

00:04:29.55,00:04:30.98
-And?[br]-Well, that's it.

00:04:31.19,00:04:34.42
People never say, "We need to talk,"[br]unless it's something bad.

00:04:34.63,00:04:37.35
That doesn't necessarily mean[br]he's breaking up with you.

00:04:37.99,00:04:38.78
Really?

00:04:38.99,00:04:41.02
Maybe he just cheated on you.

00:04:46.11,00:04:49.38
I won't get rich doing it,[br]but I gotta say, it's cool. . .

00:04:49.63,00:04:52.38
. . .knowing you're making[br]a difference in a kid's life.

00:04:52.63,00:04:54.54
That is so great.

00:04:55.91,00:04:57.14
Oh, my God!

00:04:57.59,00:04:58.86
Oh, my God!

00:04:59.11,00:05:00.86
We'd better call[br]the fire department.

00:05:02.03,00:05:03.98
Well, we don't need a fireman.

00:05:04.23,00:05:06.95
We need, like, a good mechanic.

00:05:08.23,00:05:10.87
Here they come![br]We gotta get out of here!

00:05:11.11,00:05:11.90
Wait. Why?

00:05:12.15,00:05:14.62
If I wanted to see a fireman,[br]I'd date one.

00:05:17.35,00:05:19.18
That's all it is.[br]A third nipple.

00:05:19.43,00:05:22.82
You know? Just your[br]run-of-the-mill third nipple.

00:05:23.03,00:05:26.38
You can take it off.[br]Just slice that baby right off.

00:05:26.63,00:05:29.59
Take your shirt off.[br]Let's see what we're dealing with.

00:05:32.23,00:05:33.74
What are you doing?

00:05:34.59,00:05:38.95
Just showing you my run-of-the-mill,[br]slice-it-right-off third nipple.

00:05:39.15,00:05:41.58
Well, that's not a third nipple.

00:05:41.83,00:05:44.14
First of all, it's on your ass.

00:05:45.11,00:05:46.46
Well, then what is it?

00:05:47.03,00:05:48.75
Wait a minute. Hold it.

00:05:50.91,00:05:53.22
-Jansen, come in here.[br]-I'm with Hamilton!

00:05:53.83,00:05:56.14
He's good with weird things.[br]Bring him in too.

00:05:58.79,00:06:00.74
I gotta go water Pete's plants.

00:06:00.95,00:06:04.94
You know what? lf he's gonna break up[br]with me, maybe I won't water them.

00:06:05.19,00:06:08.78
If he's gonna break up with you,[br]maybe Joey and I should do it. . .

00:06:11.59,00:06:13.54
. . .if you know what I mean.

00:06:14.11,00:06:14.94
Or. . .

00:06:15.79,00:06:17.46
. . .we could go and pee on them.

00:06:20.55,00:06:22.19
I can't take it, you know.

00:06:22.43,00:06:25.18
I'm afraid one of them[br]will catch me with the other.

00:06:25.39,00:06:26.74
It's making me crazy!

00:06:26.99,00:06:28.94
Why don't you break up[br]with one of them?

00:06:30.35,00:06:33.47
What happened to playing the field?

00:06:33.71,00:06:35.82
It doesn't feel like playing anymore.

00:06:36.03,00:06:38.94
It's feels like work.[br]It's like I'm working in the field.

00:06:39.95,00:06:41.38
So pick one of them.

00:06:41.59,00:06:42.70
Which one do you like more?

00:06:42.91,00:06:47.14
vince is great, you know?[br]Because he's, like, a "guy" guy.

00:06:47.35,00:06:51.06
He's just so burly,[br]so very burly.

00:06:52.83,00:06:55.66
Okay, good. So there you go.[br]Go with vince.

00:06:55.91,00:06:57.42
But Jason's really sensitive.

00:06:57.63,00:06:59.46
Sensitive is important.[br]Pick him.

00:07:00.95,00:07:03.34
Oh, sure.[br]Go with the sissy.

00:07:04.83,00:07:06.94
Jason is not a sissy.

00:07:07.51,00:07:08.94
I meant Chandler.

00:07:19.55,00:07:22.19
You know, I have dinner plans.

00:07:23.39,00:07:26.78
Thank you so much for coming[br]on such a short notice.

00:07:27.03,00:07:31.78
Ladies and gentlemen, I've been[br]practicing medicine for 23 years. . .

00:07:32.03,00:07:33.35
. . .and I'm stumped.

00:07:45.23,00:07:46.46
Okay, this is the den.

00:07:46.71,00:07:48.94
All right, check this out.[br]Lights!

00:07:49.83,00:07:52.55
All right, less lights![br]Bad lights!

00:07:52.79,00:07:53.82
Lights, go away!

00:07:56.23,00:07:58.42
See? You just need the right command.

00:07:59.23,00:08:01.14
And the dimmer switch.

00:08:02.43,00:08:04.50
For a rich guy, that's a small Tv.

00:08:04.71,00:08:06.19
That's the video phone.

00:08:06.43,00:08:09.18
But you shouldn't be here.[br]So don't touch anything.

00:08:10.23,00:08:13.35
IKEA, this is comfortable!

00:08:14.31,00:08:16.34
This place is amazing!

00:08:16.55,00:08:19.22
-Oh, God! That's the nicest kitchen.[br]-I know.

00:08:19.43,00:08:20.62
It's the nicest kitchen.

00:08:20.87,00:08:23.14
The refrigerator[br]told me to have a great day.

00:08:24.83,00:08:26.66
Look, a millionaire's checkbook.

00:08:26.87,00:08:28.19
Joey, put that down.

00:08:29.83,00:08:31.74
Oh, my God, that's Pete.[br]Get out!

00:08:31.99,00:08:34.34
How the hell do you answer[br]a video phone?

00:08:37.63,00:08:39.03
I guess that's how.

00:08:39.43,00:08:41.15
Monica, how's it going?

00:08:41.35,00:08:43.54
Oh, it's good. It's good.

00:08:43.79,00:08:45.43
Just here, watering the plants.

00:08:45.63,00:08:47.66
Don't forget that ficus[br]there by Rachel.

00:08:50.27,00:08:51.59
Chandler's on the couch!

00:08:53.51,00:08:56.10
I see him. You guys[br]are the worst hiders, ever.

00:08:56.31,00:08:58.98
-Hi.[br]-How you doing?

00:09:01.03,00:09:03.75
The other day when you said[br]you needed to talk. . .

00:09:03.95,00:09:06.54
. . .just so I know,[br]is it good news or bad news?

00:09:06.79,00:09:09.06
It's good news.[br]It's definitely good news.

00:09:09.55,00:09:11.86
Hold on a second,[br]I have another call.

00:09:12.11,00:09:13.22
How's it going?

00:09:13.95,00:09:15.06
It's still me.

00:09:15.39,00:09:17.14
I've got picture-in-picture here.

00:09:19.43,00:09:22.34
I'm gonna have to call you back later.

00:09:22.99,00:09:25.55
Monica? You.[br]I'm gonna have to call you back.

00:09:26.11,00:09:27.62
So I'll see you soon.

00:09:27.95,00:09:29.75
-Okay. I love you.[br]-I love you.

00:09:29.99,00:09:32.14
We love you too!

00:09:34.67,00:09:36.78
Well, it's good news.[br]It's good news.

00:09:36.99,00:09:40.03
-What do you think the good news is?[br]-Look at this!

00:09:40.23,00:09:44.35
He wrote a check for $50,000[br]to "Hugo Lindgren's Ring Design. "

00:09:46.43,00:09:49.15
Sorry. What do you think[br]the good news is?

00:09:51.11,00:09:52.10
Oh, my!

00:09:52.31,00:09:54.11
Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!

00:09:54.79,00:09:57.86
You gotta get Mom on the phone![br]Call Mom! Call Mom!

00:10:00.55,00:10:02.19
And that's Pete's mom.

00:10:08.35,00:10:11.78
You have to make it a theme wedding.[br]And the theme could be:

00:10:11.99,00:10:13.98
"Look How Much Money We've Got! "

00:10:15.67,00:10:18.39
I mean, you could put money[br]in the invitations.

00:10:18.63,00:10:21.19
You could have, like,[br]little-money place settings.

00:10:21.39,00:10:23.86
And you could start[br]with a money salad.

00:10:24.11,00:10:26.94
I mean, it'll be dry,[br]but people will like it.

00:10:27.23,00:10:28.34
Would you stop?

00:10:28.55,00:10:30.14
We've only gone out a couple of weeks.

00:10:30.35,00:10:31.75
We don't know if he'll propose.

00:10:31.99,00:10:34.18
But this is Pete.[br]He's not like other people.

00:10:34.43,00:10:36.18
On your first date, you went to Rome.

00:10:36.39,00:10:40.14
For most guys, that's like[br]a third or fourth date kind of thing.

00:10:41.43,00:10:43.99
Well, if that's what it is,[br]then it's crazy.

00:10:44.55,00:10:47.14
Monica's right.[br]We're talking about marriage here.

00:10:47.35,00:10:49.66
She can't just rush into this.

00:10:49.91,00:10:52.55
What do you know?[br]You married a lesbian!

00:10:58.31,00:11:00.66
I gotta go.[br]I have to break up with vince.

00:11:00.87,00:11:02.90
So you're going with the teacher?

00:11:03.11,00:11:06.74
I like vince a lot, you know?[br]But Jason is so sensitive.

00:11:06.95,00:11:10.22
In the long run, I think[br]sensitive is better than having. . .

00:11:10.43,00:11:13.94
. . .a really, really, really nice body.

00:11:17.43,00:11:19.54
Jason. Definitely Jason.

00:11:19.79,00:11:21.74
-Wish me luck![br]-Good luck!

00:11:24.19,00:11:25.38
Oh, my God!

00:11:28.15,00:11:28.94
Sorry.

00:11:29.19,00:11:32.39
I was imagining what it'd be like[br]to catch the money bouquet.

00:11:38.15,00:11:40.26
Excuse me. Is vince here?

00:11:40.51,00:11:41.54
Oh, sure.

00:11:46.11,00:11:48.58
I didn't know you guys[br]actually used those.

00:11:49.43,00:11:50.75
So what's up?

00:11:54.19,00:11:56.50
This isn't gonna be easy.

00:11:57.75,00:12:00.55
I don't think we should[br]see each other anymore.

00:12:03.43,00:12:04.58
Good deal.

00:12:05.95,00:12:06.78
I'm sorry.

00:12:07.03,00:12:07.90
No, it's okay.

00:12:08.83,00:12:12.79
It's just that I thought[br]we had something pretty special here.

00:12:13.03,00:12:16.94
I felt like you were someone[br]I could finally open up to.

00:12:17.15,00:12:20.35
There's so much in me[br]I haven't shared with you yet.

00:12:20.63,00:12:22.35
My God![br]I didn't know you were so--

00:12:22.55,00:12:24.35
I'm sorry. I can't talk.

00:12:26.23,00:12:28.38
I'm gonna go write in my journal.

00:12:31.79,00:12:33.02
Wait! Wait! Wait!

00:12:35.55,00:12:39.14
If you wanna take care of that thing,[br]go see my herbal guy.

00:12:39.71,00:12:42.75
Thanks. But I wanna remove it,[br]not make it savory.

00:12:44.99,00:12:48.46
When girls sleep with guys[br]with weird things on their body. . .

00:12:48.71,00:12:50.74
. . .they tell their friends about it.

00:12:51.51,00:12:52.74
Give me that.

00:12:55.63,00:12:59.42
Okay, don't be mad at me,[br]but I couldn't resist.

00:12:59.63,00:13:00.78
Bride's Magazines?

00:13:01.03,00:13:03.54
I know you said you'd say no[br]if he asked you. . .

00:13:03.75,00:13:06.74
. . .but how great would you look[br]walking down the aisle. . .

00:13:06.95,00:13:08.90
. . .in this Donna Karan?

00:13:09.59,00:13:11.54
You so would!

00:13:12.03,00:13:13.59
You should get that anyway.

00:13:15.71,00:13:17.19
Well, for clubbing.

00:13:18.31,00:13:19.54
It is so weird.

00:13:19.75,00:13:22.58
I know what I said.[br]But this morning. . .

00:13:22.83,00:13:26.14
. . .I was lying in bed, imagining[br]what it'd be like to say yes.

00:13:29.19,00:13:31.94
I know it's a little sudden,[br]and it's rushed. . .

00:13:32.19,00:13:34.70
. . .and it's not like me to do[br]something like this.

00:13:34.91,00:13:37.74
But it doesn't mean I can't.[br]Right?

00:13:37.95,00:13:39.59
I mean, I'm crazy about Pete.

00:13:39.83,00:13:42.55
And I know that[br]we want the same things.

00:13:42.79,00:13:44.94
And when I thought[br]about saying yes. . .

00:13:45.19,00:13:46.86
. . .it made me really happy.

00:13:47.07,00:13:48.34
Oh, my God!

00:13:50.11,00:13:51.18
I know.

00:13:52.11,00:13:52.94
I need more pie.

00:13:55.83,00:13:59.54
Mon, if you do get married,[br]can I bring two guests?

00:14:02.39,00:14:04.46
You didn't break up with that fireman?

00:14:04.71,00:14:06.27
That was my way of telling you.

00:14:07.31,00:14:09.66
Well, it turns out[br]he's incredibly sensitive.

00:14:09.91,00:14:11.98
He keeps a journal and he paints.

00:14:12.19,00:14:14.99
He even showed me charcoal drawings[br]that he drew of me.

00:14:15.23,00:14:19.43
He'd prefer watercolors, but he has[br]easy access to a lot of charcoal.

00:14:22.39,00:14:23.74
So will you dump Jason?

00:14:24.03,00:14:27.15
Yeah, because I have to break up[br]with someone.

00:14:27.35,00:14:31.18
So Jason is sensitive.[br]But now, so is vince.

00:14:31.39,00:14:33.46
Plus, vince has the body.[br]You know?

00:14:33.71,00:14:34.70
So. . . .

00:14:36.63,00:14:39.35
It's really just about the math.

00:14:46.59,00:14:48.15
Come on in.

00:14:56.31,00:14:58.14
You sounded serious on the phone.

00:14:58.39,00:15:00.14
Is anything wrong?

00:15:17.43,00:15:18.94
You must be Ross.

00:15:21.31,00:15:23.34
I am Guru Saj.

00:15:25.03,00:15:29.66
Listen, I gotta tell you, I've never[br]been to a guru before, so. . . .

00:15:29.87,00:15:30.78
Well, relax.

00:15:31.03,00:15:33.46
If it makes you feel any better,[br]I've attended. . .

00:15:33.71,00:15:35.94
. . .fine medical schools[br]in Central America.

00:15:36.63,00:15:39.86
Well, let's take a look[br]at this skin abnormality of yours.

00:15:40.11,00:15:41.75
Come on, have a seat.

00:15:45.79,00:15:48.43
As I suspected, it's a kundus.

00:15:50.83,00:15:51.90
What's a "kundus"?

00:15:52.11,00:15:55.34
I don't know.[br]What's a kundus with you?

00:15:59.71,00:16:00.74
Please lie down.

00:16:01.15,00:16:04.74
I've got a salve that[br]ought to shrink that right up.

00:16:04.95,00:16:06.75
I guess it's worth a try.

00:16:06.95,00:16:08.59
Sure. We should see results--

00:16:09.19,00:16:11.34
Clearly not the way to go!

00:16:12.83,00:16:14.15
What? What?

00:16:14.39,00:16:16.46
We appear to have angered it.

00:16:16.95,00:16:18.78
We? We angered it?

00:16:20.99,00:16:22.94
I think I see the problem.

00:16:23.43,00:16:26.82
And I'm afraid we're gonna[br]have to use a much stronger tool.

00:16:28.55,00:16:29.62
Love.

00:16:30.99,00:16:32.06
Oh, God!

00:16:34.03,00:16:37.46
There is absolutely no way[br]this is gonna come off. . .

00:16:37.71,00:16:39.14
. . .unless you start to. . . .

00:16:39.79,00:16:41.54
What was that?

00:16:42.43,00:16:43.54
Well, it's gone.

00:16:45.23,00:16:46.10
How's that?

00:16:46.63,00:16:48.22
Got caught in my watch.

00:16:53.51,00:16:54.54
Lights.

00:16:55.95,00:16:57.54
Romantic lights.

00:16:59.03,00:16:59.98
Nice.

00:17:00.83,00:17:04.18
So there was this thing[br]I wanted to talk to you about.

00:17:04.55,00:17:08.14
Oh, right. I'd completely[br]forgot about that.

00:17:10.83,00:17:13.02
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

00:17:13.43,00:17:15.10
And I look at my life. . .

00:17:16.71,00:17:19.91
. . .and I feel like I've conquered[br]the business world.

00:17:20.83,00:17:23.63
And I feel like I've conquered[br]the intellectual world.

00:17:24.75,00:17:27.95
And now I have the most[br]beautiful woman in the world.

00:17:31.15,00:17:32.74
But there's one thing missing.

00:17:34.07,00:17:35.22
What's that?

00:17:36.79,00:17:39.62
It's time for me to conquer[br]the physical world.

00:17:46.31,00:17:47.95
I wanna become. . .

00:17:48.63,00:17:50.94
. . .the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

00:17:52.11,00:17:53.43
You wanna what?

00:17:54.55,00:17:56.58
I wanna be[br]the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

00:17:56.83,00:17:59.55
It's the most intense[br]physical competition in the world.

00:17:59.75,00:18:01.10
It's banned in 49 states.

00:18:01.71,00:18:03.43
What are you talking about?

00:18:03.67,00:18:05.55
My trainer, Hoshi, is teaching me. . .

00:18:05.75,00:18:07.90
. . .Jeet Kune Do[br]and Brazilian streetfighting.

00:18:08.11,00:18:11.18
I even had my own[br]octagon training ring designed.

00:18:11.43,00:18:14.31
And I suppose you used[br]a ring designer for that.

00:18:17.43,00:18:20.15
I want you there,[br]in the front row, when I win.

00:18:20.35,00:18:22.74
I want you close enough[br]to smell the blood.

00:18:24.71,00:18:25.94
What do you think?

00:18:27.51,00:18:29.54
My parents will be so happy.

00:18:34.71,00:18:37.46
Crazy underwear[br]Creeping up my butt

00:18:39.59,00:18:42.79
Crazy underwear[br]Always in a rut

00:18:43.03,00:18:45.22
Crazy underwear

00:18:48.43,00:18:50.07
What is he doing here?

00:18:50.31,00:18:52.22
All right, just keep playing.

00:18:52.43,00:18:54.94
You'll get through this.[br]You'll be fine.

00:19:04.39,00:19:05.95
Okay, thank you.

00:19:06.95,00:19:10.42
And as always, no one talk to me[br]after the show.

00:19:15.35,00:19:17.38
I was passing by[br]and saw you were playing.

00:19:17.63,00:19:19.82
This is cool, seeing you up there.

00:19:22.95,00:19:24.98
What's going on here?[br]Who's this guy?

00:19:25.99,00:19:29.34
I don't know! He just started[br]kissing me. Get him, vince!

00:19:31.23,00:19:32.50
What?

00:19:33.63,00:19:35.86
I've been dating both of you.

00:19:37.19,00:19:40.15
And it's been really horrible,[br]because it's been. . .

00:19:40.39,00:19:42.19
. . .a lot of fun for me.

00:19:45.15,00:19:48.03
But I like you both. . .

00:19:48.27,00:19:50.38
. . .and I didn't know how to choose.

00:19:50.67,00:19:54.30
So I'm sorry. I'm terrible.[br]I'm a terrible person.

00:19:55.35,00:19:57.78
Relax. It's okay.[br]I mean. . . .

00:19:58.03,00:20:00.26
We never said this was exclusive.

00:20:00.51,00:20:03.07
Neither did we.[br]So give yourself a break.

00:20:04.11,00:20:05.14
Really?

00:20:06.27,00:20:08.38
We haven't been going out that long.

00:20:08.63,00:20:11.19
Come on, we haven't even[br]slept together yet.

00:20:11.95,00:20:13.35
You haven't?

00:20:15.99,00:20:16.78
You have?

00:20:16.99,00:20:19.14
Well, this is none of my business.

00:20:21.87,00:20:24.83
I can't believe this![br]You slept with him?

00:20:25.11,00:20:27.75
Well, I made you[br]a candlelight dinner in the park.

00:20:29.79,00:20:32.75
I'm gonna make this real easy for you.

00:20:38.31,00:20:40.54
That could've been really awkward.

00:20:43.55,00:20:46.54
You made him a candlelight dinner[br]in the park?

00:20:46.83,00:20:50.10
Yeah, but I can do that for you.[br]I'm gonna do that for you.

00:20:50.31,00:20:52.74
I can't believe[br]I went out with somebody. . .

00:20:52.99,00:20:56.34
. . .who'd have an open flame[br]in the middle of a wooded area!

00:21:05.19,00:21:07.54
Everything's gonna be all right.

00:21:08.63,00:21:10.14
Okay, Dick?

00:21:13.03,00:21:14.86
Hello. I am Guru Saj.

00:21:18.23,00:21:20.54
He's a duck, right?[br]Because otherwise. . .

00:21:20.79,00:21:22.74
. . .this is way out of my league.

00:21:23.67,00:21:27.46
He's got a really bad cough,[br]and our vet can't stop it.

00:21:27.67,00:21:29.34
Is there something you can do?

00:21:29.79,00:21:31.19
Let me see.

00:21:31.99,00:21:33.58
Let me see.

00:21:35.55,00:21:38.14
Do you think you could get him[br]to eat a bat?
