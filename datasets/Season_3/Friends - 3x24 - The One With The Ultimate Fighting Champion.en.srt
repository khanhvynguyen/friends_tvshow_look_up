00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Are you still on hold?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I was supposed to call my dad back[br]two hours ago.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, yeah. He clicked on.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Call him as soon as you get a chance.[br]He's at Flimbees.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What's Flimbees?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
That's the word I use when[br]I can't remember the real thing.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Okay, hang up! That's it. Come on!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
No. That's what they want me to do.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
My warranty expires tomorrow.[br]If I don't get through. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .they won't fix my crappy,[br]broken phone for free!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
We cannot let them win![br]It's us versus them!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Yes!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I gotta double-check for tickets[br]tonight. Who got what?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I have one.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I need two. I'm bringing Pete.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
My boyfriend.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I have a boyfriend now.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Two it is. How about you?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Yeah, I also need two.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Really? Who's number two?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Whose Number Two? One of the more[br]difficult games sewer workers play.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
No, it's just this person.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Like a date-type person?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Yeah, kind of.[br]It's this woman from work.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I hope that won't be too weird.[br]Will it, Rach?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Not at all. I was actually[br]gonna bring someone myself.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
But you said one ticket.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I meant me plus one.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Okay. Did you guys mean you plus one?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
All right. I'll see you tonight.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Okay. Bye-bye.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Bye-bye.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Okay, I need a date!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, hey! You guys are finally[br]gonna get to meet Kate!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And I borrowed your cologne.[br]I hope she likes it.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What are you doing?[br]She's seeing somebody.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Yeah, and I don't have any cologne.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-Bottle next to the shaving cream.[br]-Worm medicine for the duck.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-Here you go. You can wear this.[br]-Thanks.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I'm setting the phone down.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
But I'm still here.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Just don't go anywhere.[br]I'm still here.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Don't switch or anything, because[br]I'm right here. Just one sec.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
One sec. One second!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Wait! One second! Just. . . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What? Monica, I'm scared!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Honey, that's a sleeve.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And we also have a speakerphone.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Please stay on the line.[br]Your call is important to us.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You gotta hang up.[br]We'll be late.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Thank you for your patience.[br]You're the next caller.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Yes! Yes! I'm the next caller!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You were gonna have me hang up.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Can you take a duck and a chick[br]to the theater?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Of course not.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I just wanted them to hear it[br]from somebody else.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, hi, how are you?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Good.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-Looks like we're the first ones here.[br]-Looks that way.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
First ones here!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, Tommy, this is Ross.[br]Ross, Tommy.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, I'm sorry. This is Cailin.[br]Cailin--

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Sorry.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And break!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I think I'm gonna run[br]to the ladies' room.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-I'll join you.[br]-I'll get our seats.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, this is. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .awkward.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, because Rachel and I[br]used to go out.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, I didn't know that.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, then this is awkward.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-So what do you. . .?[br]-I think we're here.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I think you may be in our seats.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
No, I don't think so.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-Could we take a look at your ticket?[br]-Sure.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Yeah. Yeah, see, this says, "D-1 3" . . . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, well, I thought that--

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You thought? Well, that didn't[br]really work out for you. Idiot!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What are you, a moron?[br]It says, "D-1 3" ! Okay?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You're surrounded by even numbers![br]Does that give you a clue?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-The usher told me--[br]-The usher must be right!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
With all his training!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Get out!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Here!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-Hey, man, you want the aisle?[br]-No, I'm good.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-There he is![br]-There's our star!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You were great!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
So? What'd you think?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Almost as good as the play with[br]the two naked girls on the seesaw.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-I wasn't in that.[br]-I know.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I want you to meet everybody.[br]Everybody, this is Kate.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Excuse me. Excuse me.[br]Sweetheart!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Come!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
So that's the girl you like.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I tell you, this guy[br]Rachel is with is crazy.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
He viciously screamed at total[br]strangers. I think he's bad news.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Wait a minute. You don't like[br]the guy Rachel's dating?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, that's odd.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, hey, Lauren. You guys, this is[br]Kate's understudy, Lauren.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Hey, gosh, you look so familiar.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I ran into you in the hallway[br]in your building.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
It was right after I slept with Joey.[br]He dumped me the next day.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
So how'd you guys meet?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
The short version is, I pursued[br]her for a couple of months.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Then I gave her a check for $20,000[br]and she was mine.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
In the long version, I dump him[br]for telling people the short version.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You guys, this is my agent, Estelle.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
How do you do?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, you two girls were outstanding!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Do they have representation?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
They weren't in the play.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
We're not actors.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What a shame!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
With her face and her chest,[br]I could really put something together.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Could I borrow it?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Hi. Remember me?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Hi. Yeah. Tommy's in line[br]for the bathroom. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .and someone just cut.[br]I think he's gonna snap.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I'm gonna go.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Go? Why?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I don't know. Could be[br]because I don't feel like. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .waiting all night for a guy[br]who may or may not scream.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
He definitely will scream.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Goodbye.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Here we go, people!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
"Boxing Day.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
The Lucille Lortel Theatre. . . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Joey Tribbiani gives[br]an uneven performance.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
But Mr. Tribbiani is not the worst[br]thing in this production. "

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Yes!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
"Kate Miller's awkward and mannered[br]portrayal is laughable. "

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Here it is! "The direction. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Thank you, boys and girls.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You've ruined my life.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Please stuff your talentless faces. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .with my mother's crab cakes!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Excuse me!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Does anyone mind if I save this?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-Is the play over?[br]-Where were you?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Thank you for your patience.[br]You're the next caller.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You were "the next caller" hours ago.[br]You must be going crazy.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I've kept myself busy.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Okay, yeah, I put your stuff in[br]her room and her stuff in your room.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You okay?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Fabulous.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Drama critics, they're nothing but[br]people who couldn't make it as actors.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-You know what to do?[br]-Become a drama critic.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I am hurt!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
A plague. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .on both your houses!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
By the way, he dumped me tonight[br]after he read my review.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, classy.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I sure know how to pick them.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You know I gave up a part[br]on a soap for this?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I gave up a job too.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-Really? What?[br]-Declawing cats.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Hey, tell you what,[br]let me walk you home.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
We'll stop by every newsstand and burn[br]every copy of The Times and The Post.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-Why The Post?[br]-You didn't see The Post?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-No. You?[br]-No. Why?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You really think these newspapers[br]are just jealous of me?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Absolutely. You're talented[br]and you're good-looking.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You're sweet and cute.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I know. That's why they trashed me.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-Wait. Wait a minute.[br]-What?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I don't get you.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I mean, first you hate me.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Then you sleep with me.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Then you want nothing to do with me.[br]Now you want me again?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You never went out[br]with an actress before?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Kate, do you even like me?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-Of course I do.[br]-So how come you blew me off?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-How come you were with him?[br]-I don't know.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I just do this.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I always have to pick, like,[br]the smartest guy. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .or the most talented guy.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Why can't I just[br]pick someone like you?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Thanks.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You know what I mean.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I mean, like, the sweetest guy.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You're just so. . . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You're so. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
: : :so: : : :

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Here we go.[br]Let's get your feet up there.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Good night.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Sweet dreams.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I'm gonna put this can right here[br]in case you have to hurl.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Please stay on the line.[br]Your call is very important to us.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You've been up for 24 hours.[br]Go to sleep.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
This isn't healthy.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
No, no, I'm fine.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And you know why?[br]Because of all the riboflavin.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Didn't you have that on last night?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I stayed at Kate's[br]but nothing happened.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Hey, where were you?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I'm so, so sorry.[br]I am definitely gonna see your play.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I swear, your play is very important[br]to us. Thank you for your patience.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Your play is the next play[br]I'm gonna see.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
How'd it go with Kate?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
It was great!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I walked her home, and it was[br]amazing how much we connected.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Then she passed out.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
But then she woke up.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And we stayed up all night talking.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And now we're crazy about each other!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You had "the night" !

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
When two people realize[br]their feelings for each other. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .and they talk for hours and learn[br]all about the other person.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You think?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-Did you learn about her family?[br]-Two brothers. One died!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Yes!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
This is from the woman at the bar.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Sorry. She thought[br]you were somebody else.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-What time is it?[br]-One.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
7: 1 5.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Watch doesn't work.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Tommy's supposed to be here soon.[br]We're going to lunch.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Look, I wasn't gonna[br]say anything to you, but. . . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
All right, I don't think[br]you should be seeing Tommy anymore.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You don't?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
The guy is mean. I mean, really mean.[br]I think you should stay away from him.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Or maybe I should stay away[br]from all men.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
It's not just because I'm jealous.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I mean, I'm not. I'm not jealous.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Look, the guy actually screamed[br]at this couple sitting in our seats.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Yeah, and at the end of the play. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .he got up, and he just started,[br]like, banging his hands together.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You don't want to believe me,[br]that's fine.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
We're kidding.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
No one believe me.[br]I'm Mr. Funny to you. Mr. Funny!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-Sorry, Tommy.[br]-What's in the cup?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What is in the cup?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Okay, it's coffee.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Iced coffee?[br]Tell me it's iced coffee.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-It's hot--[br]-Hot coffee!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You idiot! You gonna spill[br]hot coffee all over me, huh?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What are you? Just a big, stupid[br]doofy idiot with a doofy idiot hairdo?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What's your favorite thing[br]about summertime?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Going to the beach[br]when it stays light real late.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What's your favorite thing[br]about summer?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I don't know. Probably the smell[br]of freshly cut grass.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
That's a good one.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Sorry! Sorry I'm late! My duck and[br]my chick had a fight. It was ugly.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
We held the curtain for you.[br]Let's go!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
vic! Where have you been, baby?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Where's Kate?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
She got a job in L.A.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I've been waiting up all night[br]for you. Where have you been?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Where have you been, vic?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Go to the window. I wanna run down[br]to the truck and show you something.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What do you got down there, vic?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What do you got under that tarp?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
When is she leaving?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Tonight. What are you doing?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I'm coming up!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Hey, you mind if I use the phone?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Use ours across the hall[br]because she. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .has problems.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Thanks.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Sorry, Tommy.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I almost spilled this[br]hot coffee on you.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Yeah, but you didn't.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
No, but. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .it's hot.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Would you stop it?[br]It's getting really old.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I can't believe no one believes me.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I do. I believe you.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You do?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Yeah. But I also believed her[br]when she said I was next.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Hey there, little fella.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Mr. Fuzzy Man, how you doing?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Gross!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Idiot!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Stupid, little, fuzzy, yellow creature!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
"Oh, look at me! I'm so cute![br]I'm a little chick who's disgusting! "

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You're so stupid![br]How are you not yet extinct?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What are you quacking about?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Dumb Donald Dodo!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Step away from the duck.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Sorry, little Mr. Chickadee.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Sorry you went doody in my hand!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I guess we're not going out anymore.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Man!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Joey, I'm so glad I caught you.[br]I couldn't find you before.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What's all this about L.A.?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
They still want me[br]for General Hospital.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
But. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .what about us?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Last night was wonderful.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
But I can't stay here just for you.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
So stay for the museums.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-I'm sorry.[br]-Joey, on-stage!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
At least stay till the end[br]of the play.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I'll go to the airport with you.[br]I want to say goodbye.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Where are you, vic?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Flight's in an hour.[br]I gotta go.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
vic?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
vic?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-vic![br]-In a minute!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
So this is it, victor?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Yeah. I guess it is.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Listen. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .I gotta say goodbye, and I gotta say[br]it quick because this is killing me.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
One thing you gotta know[br]is that I will never forget you.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
But you got things[br]you have to do now.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And so do l.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And so. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .I'm gonna get on[br]this spaceship. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .and I'm gonna go to Blaargon-7[br]in search of alternative fuels.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
But when I return[br]200 years from now. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .you'll be long gone. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .but I won't have aged at all.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
So you tell your great,[br]great granddaughter. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .to look me up.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Because, Adrianne. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .baby. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .I'm gonna want to meet her.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
So long, vic!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
It's been two days.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Yeah, I know.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Good thing it's one of those[br]801 numbers, right?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Phoebe, 800 is toll free.[br]801 is Utah.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
It has to be 800 because all those[br]big companies have 800 numbers.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Every. . . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Yeah, every big Utah-based company[br]has one.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Sorry. I'm so sorry.[br]I will pay you back.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And yet she's still not[br]hanging up the phone.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-Hang up![br]-Hang up the phone!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Fine! Fine!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, I think I broke it.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
But that's all right.[br]Here's the number where you can call.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Wouldn't it be cool if our duck[br]and our chick had a baby?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
We could call it Chuck.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Or Dick.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Listen, I need a favor.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I was in the shower,[br]and as I was. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .cleansing myself, I felt something.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Was it like a sneeze, only better?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
No. I mean, like,[br]a thing on my body.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, what was it?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, I don't know.[br]It's kind of in a place that's not. . . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
It's not visually accessible to me.[br]And I was hoping maybe you guys. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .could help me out.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Come on, you guys![br]It's no big deal!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, what is it?[br]ls it a mole?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Is it--?[br]What, a pimple?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
No, it's. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .fancier than a pimple.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-Ross, just go see a doc--[br]-Guys, what's--?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, it's definite.[br]Two more weeks of winter.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Yeah, right.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

Fire safety is not a joke, son.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You're right. I know.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

He's cute, Pheebs.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
But you just started dating[br]that teacher.

Oh, Jason?

We're seeing each other tonight.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, Pheebs?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Two dates in one day?[br]That's so unlike you.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I know, I know.[br]I'm, like, playing the field.

I'm juggling two guys.[br]I'm sowing my wild oats.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
So do they know about each other?

Does a dog's lips move[br]when he reads?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Okay, no, they don't know.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Hey, guys.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-Well?[br]-How'd it go at the doctor's?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
He said there's definitely[br]nothing to worry about. It's benign.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-What is it?[br]-He couldn't even tell me.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
He said it was just[br]some sort of "skin abnormality. "

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
The worse thing is, he said,[br]being unable to identify it. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .he was reluctant to remove it.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You should go to my guy.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Because when I went in there[br]with my third nipple. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .he just lopped it right off.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
So I guess I'm lucky.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I mean, not as lucky as people[br]who are born with two nipples.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
At least they knew what yours was.[br]You know? Yours had a name.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Maybe they'll name yours after you.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You know?[br]They'd call it "The Ross. "

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And then people would be, like,[br]"Oh, he's got a Ross. "

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Yeah, that'd be cool.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Pete's breaking up with me.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I just checked my messages.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
He said that when he gets back,[br]"We need to talk. "

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-And?[br]-Well, that's it.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
People never say, "We need to talk,"[br]unless it's something bad.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
That doesn't necessarily mean[br]he's breaking up with you.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Really?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Maybe he just cheated on you.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I won't get rich doing it,[br]but I gotta say, it's cool. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .knowing you're making[br]a difference in a kid's life.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
That is so great.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, my God!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, my God!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
We'd better call[br]the fire department.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, we don't need a fireman.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
We need, like, a good mechanic.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Here they come![br]We gotta get out of here!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Wait. Why?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
If I wanted to see a fireman,[br]I'd date one.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
That's all it is.[br]A third nipple.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You know? Just your[br]run-of-the-mill third nipple.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You can take it off.[br]Just slice that baby right off.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Take your shirt off.[br]Let's see what we're dealing with.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What are you doing?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Just showing you my run-of-the-mill,[br]slice-it-right-off third nipple.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, that's not a third nipple.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
First of all, it's on your ass.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, then what is it?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Wait a minute. Hold it.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-Jansen, come in here.[br]-I'm with Hamilton!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
He's good with weird things.[br]Bring him in too.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I gotta go water Pete's plants.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You know what? lf he's gonna break up[br]with me, maybe I won't water them.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
If he's gonna break up with you,[br]maybe Joey and I should do it. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .if you know what I mean.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Or. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .we could go and pee on them.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I can't take it, you know.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I'm afraid one of them[br]will catch me with the other.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
It's making me crazy!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Why don't you break up[br]with one of them?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What happened to playing the field?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
It doesn't feel like playing anymore.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
It's feels like work.[br]It's like I'm working in the field.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
So pick one of them.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Which one do you like more?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
vince is great, you know?[br]Because he's, like, a "guy" guy.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
He's just so burly,[br]so very burly.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Okay, good. So there you go.[br]Go with vince.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
But Jason's really sensitive.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Sensitive is important.[br]Pick him.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, sure.[br]Go with the sissy.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Jason is not a sissy.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I meant Chandler.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You know, I have dinner plans.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Thank you so much for coming[br]on such a short notice.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Ladies and gentlemen, I've been[br]practicing medicine for 23 years. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .and I'm stumped.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Okay, this is the den.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
All right, check this out.[br]Lights!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
All right, less lights![br]Bad lights!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Lights, go away!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
See? You just need the right command.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And the dimmer switch.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
For a rich guy, that's a small Tv.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
That's the video phone.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
But you shouldn't be here.[br]So don't touch anything.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
IKEA, this is comfortable!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
This place is amazing!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-Oh, God! That's the nicest kitchen.[br]-I know.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
It's the nicest kitchen.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
The refrigerator[br]told me to have a great day.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Look, a millionaire's checkbook.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Joey, put that down.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, my God, that's Pete.[br]Get out!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
How the hell do you answer[br]a video phone?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I guess that's how.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Monica, how's it going?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, it's good. It's good.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Just here, watering the plants.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Don't forget that ficus[br]there by Rachel.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Chandler's on the couch!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I see him. You guys[br]are the worst hiders, ever.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-Hi.[br]-How you doing?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
The other day when you said[br]you needed to talk. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .just so I know,[br]is it good news or bad news?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
It's good news.[br]It's definitely good news.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Hold on a second,[br]I have another call.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
How's it going?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
It's still me.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I've got picture-in-picture here.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I'm gonna have to call you back later.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Monica? You.[br]I'm gonna have to call you back.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
So I'll see you soon.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-Okay. I love you.[br]-I love you.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
We love you too!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, it's good news.[br]It's good news.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-What do you think the good news is?[br]-Look at this!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
He wrote a check for $50,000[br]to "Hugo Lindgren's Ring Design. "

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Sorry. What do you think[br]the good news is?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, my!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You gotta get Mom on the phone![br]Call Mom! Call Mom!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And that's Pete's mom.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You have to make it a theme wedding.[br]And the theme could be:

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
"Look How Much Money We've Got! "

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I mean, you could put money[br]in the invitations.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You could have, like,[br]little-money place settings.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And you could start[br]with a money salad.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I mean, it'll be dry,[br]but people will like it.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Would you stop?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
We've only gone out a couple of weeks.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
We don't know if he'll propose.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
But this is Pete.[br]He's not like other people.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
On your first date, you went to Rome.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
For most guys, that's like[br]a third or fourth date kind of thing.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, if that's what it is,[br]then it's crazy.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Monica's right.[br]We're talking about marriage here.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
She can't just rush into this.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What do you know?[br]You married a lesbian!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I gotta go.[br]I have to break up with vince.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
So you're going with the teacher?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I like vince a lot, you know?[br]But Jason is so sensitive.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
In the long run, I think[br]sensitive is better than having. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .a really, really, really nice body.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Jason. Definitely Jason.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-Wish me luck![br]-Good luck!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, my God!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Sorry.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I was imagining what it'd be like[br]to catch the money bouquet.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Excuse me. Is vince here?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, sure.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I didn't know you guys[br]actually used those.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
So what's up?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
This isn't gonna be easy.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I don't think we should[br]see each other anymore.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Good deal.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I'm sorry.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
No, it's okay.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
It's just that I thought[br]we had something pretty special here.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I felt like you were someone[br]I could finally open up to.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
There's so much in me[br]I haven't shared with you yet.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
My God![br]I didn't know you were so--

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I'm sorry. I can't talk.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I'm gonna go write in my journal.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Wait! Wait! Wait!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
If you wanna take care of that thing,[br]go see my herbal guy.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Thanks. But I wanna remove it,[br]not make it savory.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
When girls sleep with guys[br]with weird things on their body. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .they tell their friends about it.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Give me that.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Okay, don't be mad at me,[br]but I couldn't resist.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Bride's Magazines?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I know you said you'd say no[br]if he asked you. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .but how great would you look[br]walking down the aisle. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .in this Donna Karan?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You so would!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You should get that anyway.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, for clubbing.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
It is so weird.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I know what I said.[br]But this morning. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .I was lying in bed, imagining[br]what it'd be like to say yes.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I know it's a little sudden,[br]and it's rushed. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .and it's not like me to do[br]something like this.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
But it doesn't mean I can't.[br]Right?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I mean, I'm crazy about Pete.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And I know that[br]we want the same things.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And when I thought[br]about saying yes. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .it made me really happy.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, my God!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I know.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I need more pie.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Mon, if you do get married,[br]can I bring two guests?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You didn't break up with that fireman?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
That was my way of telling you.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, it turns out[br]he's incredibly sensitive.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
He keeps a journal and he paints.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
He even showed me charcoal drawings[br]that he drew of me.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
He'd prefer watercolors, but he has[br]easy access to a lot of charcoal.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
So will you dump Jason?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Yeah, because I have to break up[br]with someone.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
So Jason is sensitive.[br]But now, so is vince.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Plus, vince has the body.[br]You know?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
So. . . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
It's really just about the math.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Come on in.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You sounded serious on the phone.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Is anything wrong?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You must be Ross.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I am Guru Saj.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Listen, I gotta tell you, I've never[br]been to a guru before, so. . . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, relax.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
If it makes you feel any better,[br]I've attended. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .fine medical schools[br]in Central America.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, let's take a look[br]at this skin abnormality of yours.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Come on, have a seat.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
As I suspected, it's a kundus.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What's a "kundus"?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I don't know.[br]What's a kundus with you?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Please lie down.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I've got a salve that[br]ought to shrink that right up.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I guess it's worth a try.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Sure. We should see results--

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Clearly not the way to go!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What? What?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
We appear to have angered it.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
We? We angered it?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I think I see the problem.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And I'm afraid we're gonna[br]have to use a much stronger tool.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Love.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, God!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
There is absolutely no way[br]this is gonna come off. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .unless you start to. . . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What was that?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, it's gone.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
How's that?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Got caught in my watch.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Lights.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Romantic lights.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Nice.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
So there was this thing[br]I wanted to talk to you about.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, right. I'd completely[br]forgot about that.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And I look at my life. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .and I feel like I've conquered[br]the business world.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And I feel like I've conquered[br]the intellectual world.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And now I have the most[br]beautiful woman in the world.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
But there's one thing missing.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What's that?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
It's time for me to conquer[br]the physical world.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I wanna become. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You wanna what?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I wanna be[br]the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
It's the most intense[br]physical competition in the world.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
It's banned in 49 states.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What are you talking about?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
My trainer, Hoshi, is teaching me. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .Jeet Kune Do[br]and Brazilian streetfighting.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I even had my own[br]octagon training ring designed.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And I suppose you used[br]a ring designer for that.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I want you there,[br]in the front row, when I win.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I want you close enough[br]to smell the blood.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What do you think?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
My parents will be so happy.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Crazy underwear[br]Creeping up my butt

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Crazy underwear[br]Always in a rut

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Crazy underwear

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What is he doing here?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
All right, just keep playing.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You'll get through this.[br]You'll be fine.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Okay, thank you.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And as always, no one talk to me[br]after the show.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I was passing by[br]and saw you were playing.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
This is cool, seeing you up there.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What's going on here?[br]Who's this guy?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I don't know! He just started[br]kissing me. Get him, vince!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I've been dating both of you.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And it's been really horrible,[br]because it's been. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .a lot of fun for me.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
But I like you both. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .and I didn't know how to choose.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
So I'm sorry. I'm terrible.[br]I'm a terrible person.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Relax. It's okay.[br]I mean. . . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
We never said this was exclusive.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Neither did we.[br]So give yourself a break.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Really?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
We haven't been going out that long.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Come on, we haven't even[br]slept together yet.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You haven't?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You have?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, this is none of my business.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I can't believe this![br]You slept with him?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, I made you[br]a candlelight dinner in the park.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I'm gonna make this real easy for you.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
That could've been really awkward.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You made him a candlelight dinner[br]in the park?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Yeah, but I can do that for you.[br]I'm gonna do that for you.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I can't believe[br]I went out with somebody. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .who'd have an open flame[br]in the middle of a wooded area!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Everything's gonna be all right.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Okay, Dick?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Hello. I am Guru Saj.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
He's a duck, right?[br]Because otherwise. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .this is way out of my league.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
He's got a really bad cough,[br]and our vet can't stop it.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Is there something you can do?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Let me see.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Let me see.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Do you think you could get him[br]to eat a bat?

00:00:03.62,00:00:06.89
Do you think there's a town[br]in Missouri or someplace. . .

00:00:07.14,00:00:08.46
. . .called Sample?

00:00:08.66,00:00:12.45
And as you' re driving into the town,[br]there's a sign and it says:

00:00:12.70,00:00:14.61
"You' re in Sample. "

00:00:18.70,00:00:20.65
-How did it go with Pete?[br]-Tell us.

00:00:20.86,00:00:23.05
You' re not gonna believe this.[br]So I go--

00:00:23.30,00:00:25.21
I' m sorry. Excuse us.

00:00:28.34,00:00:31.09
-It's a little crowded. Do you mind?[br]-Could you skooch?

00:00:31.54,00:00:33.13
Move over just a little bit.

00:00:34.50,00:00:35.73
Keep on skooching.

00:00:37.26,00:00:40.61
So, guys, listen.[br]I go over there and, you know, I' m--

00:00:40.82,00:00:42.73
Why? What is wrong with me?

00:00:42.98,00:00:44.73
-What's the matter?[br]-Tim. . .

00:00:44.98,00:00:46.65
. . .I have a feeling. . .

00:00:46.86,00:00:50.45
. . .my wife is sleeping[br]with her gynecologist.

00:00:53.14,00:00:54.29
How do you know?

00:00:54.54,00:00:56.02
-He's got access.[br]-I know.

00:00:58.06,00:00:59.49
It's a feeling you get.

00:00:59.74,00:01:01.85
Like when you' re in[br]somebody else's bowling shoes?

00:01:02.10,00:01:03.05
That's the one.

00:01:04.62,00:01:06.89
-So you went to Pete's.[br]-What happened?

00:01:07.14,00:01:09.33
Why is this happening to me?

00:01:09.58,00:01:11.09
Maybe it's my wound.

00:01:11.54,00:01:12.33
Forget it.

00:01:14.18,00:01:15.53
It's not healed yet?

00:01:15.78,00:01:17.10
It's oozing!

00:01:17.54,00:01:19.89
Would you pass the cream?[br]There's the cream.

00:01:20.14,00:01:21.46
Thank you very much.

00:01:22.50,00:01:26.25
Tomas, this is gonna be hard,[br]but I wanted it to come from me.

00:01:26.46,00:01:29.05
-What is it?[br]-I've been sleeping with your wife.

00:01:29.30,00:01:30.29
You' re the gynecologist?

00:01:30.54,00:01:33.13
I' m trying to have[br]a private conversation.

00:01:34.86,00:01:37.58
Can I have a napkin?[br]Could you please hand me a napkin?

00:01:37.82,00:01:40.09
Just give me the thing, all right?

00:01:41.54,00:01:42.33
Enough!

00:01:42.58,00:01:44.85
And you are no longer my friend!

00:01:45.06,00:01:46.97
We are finished! Nada! No more!

00:01:47.22,00:01:49.09
You are a bastard for doing that!

00:01:49.34,00:01:50.74
Stay away from me!

00:01:51.54,00:01:52.49
Come back!

00:02:00.54,00:02:03.26
So what were you gonna tell us?

00:02:04.22,00:02:05.33
I have no idea.

00:02:07.50,00:02:09.61
The One With[br]the Ultimate Fighting Champion

00:02:10.90,00:02:11.89
English Subtitles by[br]GELULA & CO., INC.

00:02:54.38,00:02:56.89
What was the big news[br]Pete wanted to tell you?

00:02:57.14,00:02:59.25
Or should I say, "Mrs. Monica Becker"?

00:03:00.02,00:03:02.25
Oh, keep your name.[br]Don't take his name.

00:03:02.54,00:03:04.57
He didn't ask me to marry him.

00:03:04.78,00:03:07.09
Then definitely don't take his name!

00:03:08.54,00:03:11.85
He wanted to tell me he's going[br]to compete in some Ultimate. . .

00:03:12.06,00:03:13.78
. . .Fighting Competition thingy.

00:03:13.98,00:03:16.25
-Pete?[br]-Why? What is it?

00:03:16.50,00:03:18.97
I don't know exactly.[br]It's sort of like wrestling.

00:03:20.26,00:03:22.05
But without the costumes.

00:03:23.30,00:03:25.33
And it's not fake.[br]It's totally brutal.

00:03:25.58,00:03:29.62
It's two guys in the ring and[br]the rules are, "There are no rules" !

00:03:30.46,00:03:32.89
You can bite and pull[br]people's hair and stuff?

00:03:33.14,00:03:36.25
Anything goes except eye-gouging[br]and fish-hooking.

00:03:36.46,00:03:38.81
-What's fish-hooking?[br]-What's fish-hook--

00:03:41.34,00:03:44.17
Thanks. That would have been[br]hard to describe.

00:03:44.54,00:03:45.97
What is that taste?

00:03:46.62,00:03:50.05
My hands are totally clean.[br]I just gave the duck a bath.

00:03:53.74,00:03:55.22
Thanks for the warm welcome.

00:03:55.50,00:03:59.70
It's good to have you guys on my team.[br]I come to play. I hope you do too.

00:03:59.94,00:04:02.29
Let's go out there and get them![br]And remember:

00:04:02.54,00:04:04.97
There is no "I" in "team. "

00:04:05.22,00:04:09.05
Yes, but there's two in "martini. "[br]So, everybody, back to my office.

00:04:10.02,00:04:12.74
You! Chuckles. What's your name?

00:04:12.98,00:04:14.97
It's Bing, sir.[br]I' m sorry. I was just. . . .

00:04:15.22,00:04:18.45
No, no. I heard what you said.[br]Funny. I like funny.

00:04:18.74,00:04:21.49
This team's about hard work,[br]but it's also about having fun.

00:04:21.74,00:04:23.65
Good to have you aboard, Bing!

00:04:30.58,00:04:32.01
That's right. Ryder.

00:04:32.70,00:04:34.97
Winona Ryder for six.

00:04:37.50,00:04:38.41
Thank you.

00:04:38.62,00:04:40.81
Yeah. We have the reservations.

00:04:41.54,00:04:43.45
All right, buddy! Way to go!

00:04:46.02,00:04:47.34
Dude, what are you doing?

00:04:47.94,00:04:52.17
Thank you. My boss keeps slapping my[br]butt, and acting like it's no big deal.

00:04:52.38,00:04:53.86
What'd you do about it?

00:04:54.06,00:04:56.70
I didn't do anything.[br]I didn't want to be the guy. . .

00:04:56.94,00:04:59.66
. . .who has a problem with his boss[br]slapping his bottom.

00:05:00.50,00:05:03.65
I gotta tell you, I think it's okay[br]to be that guy.

00:05:04.66,00:05:06.06
Maybe it's that jock thing.

00:05:06.26,00:05:09.85
You know, how football players[br]pat each other after touchdowns.

00:05:12.06,00:05:14.09
You know, I don't understand guys.

00:05:14.34,00:05:17.65
I mean, I would never congratulate[br]Monica on a great stew. . .

00:05:17.86,00:05:20.01
. . .by, you know, grabbing her boob.

00:05:21.74,00:05:23.89
I know. For a really great stew,[br]you'd just. . .

00:05:24.14,00:05:25.86
. . .stick your head in between them.

00:05:27.50,00:05:28.85
Can we please go eat?

00:05:29.10,00:05:32.06
-Yeah, what are we getting?[br]-Anything but stew.

00:05:33.02,00:05:36.37
So from now on, don't give[br]your boss a chance to get you.

00:05:36.62,00:05:38.26
Don't turn your back to him.

00:05:38.86,00:05:41.29
Or you could teach him[br]a lesson, you know?

00:05:41.54,00:05:45.93
What you do is rub something that[br]smells really bad on your butt, right?

00:05:46.14,00:05:49.37
Then, when he goes to smack you,[br]his hand will smell.

00:05:52.10,00:05:55.53
Now, what could you rub on your butt[br]that would smell bad?

00:05:58.42,00:06:00.33
What if Joey was President?

00:06:03.62,00:06:04.94
Can I ask you something?

00:06:05.62,00:06:07.29
Okay, you can totally say no. . .

00:06:07.50,00:06:11.38
. . .but would it be okay with you[br]if I set Ross up on a date?

00:06:13.54,00:06:14.33
With who?

00:06:14.58,00:06:17.30
My friend Bonnie.[br]She always thought Ross was cute. . .

00:06:17.54,00:06:20.05
. . .and she asked if I could set it up.

00:06:20.26,00:06:22.85
-But if that's not cool. . . .[br]-Which one is Bonnie?

00:06:23.10,00:06:25.45
You remember her from[br]my birthday party?

00:06:25.70,00:06:27.73
Average height. . .

00:06:27.98,00:06:30.09
. . .medium build, bald. . . .

00:06:33.82,00:06:35.17
That's fine.

00:06:35.78,00:06:38.85
Great! Okay! Good for you![br]All right!

00:06:44.26,00:06:46.98
You are iron! You are steel!

00:06:47.66,00:06:51.05
Let me ask you, how come when I call[br]your computer support line. . .

00:06:51.26,00:06:53.25
. . .I have to wait an hour and a half?

00:06:53.50,00:06:56.85
We' re adding operators all the time.[br]Could we concentrate on my training?

00:06:57.06,00:07:00.33
It's just hard when I know[br]I have e-mail I can't get.

00:07:06.22,00:07:07.05
Hi, honey.

00:07:07.26,00:07:09.33
On the table. On the table, please.

00:07:12.74,00:07:15.85
So listen, my friends were[br]telling me a little bit about. . .

00:07:16.06,00:07:17.78
. . .this Ultimate Fighting thing.

00:07:18.02,00:07:19.89
It sounds really dangerous.

00:07:20.14,00:07:23.10
I don't want you to get hurt[br]because I kind of like you.

00:07:23.30,00:07:26.57
I don't want to get hurt either.[br]I' m being smart about this.

00:07:26.82,00:07:29.70
See these guys? They' re[br]the best trainers in the world.

00:07:29.94,00:07:32.66
And Hoshi here used to be[br]a paid assassin.

00:07:33.42,00:07:35.89
A house painter![br]He used to be a house painter!

00:07:38.34,00:07:41.06
-Promise me you'll be careful.[br]-I promise.

00:07:41.26,00:07:44.14
Are we still on for tonight?[br]Good. Because. . .

00:07:44.34,00:07:46.98
. . .maybe we could have[br]a little workout of our own.

00:07:47.22,00:07:48.86
No boom-boom before big fight!

00:07:53.66,00:07:54.93
How about just a boom?

00:07:59.42,00:08:01.65
That was depressing.[br]I just bought a pretzel. . .

00:08:01.86,00:08:03.85
. . .from one of the kids from Fame.

00:08:04.70,00:08:07.61
Ready to go to the movies?[br]Oh, this is Bonnie!

00:08:09.82,00:08:10.93
This is Bonnie?

00:08:11.18,00:08:13.05
This is Bonnie? You' re Bonnie?

00:08:13.26,00:08:16.06
I can show you an l.D. if you want.

00:08:16.26,00:08:20.14
Oh, no. You look a lot different[br]than the last time I saw you.

00:08:20.38,00:08:23.13
Oh, yeah. Well, I just[br]started wearing bras again.

00:08:23.90,00:08:25.57
Oh, that must be it.

00:08:27.06,00:08:28.25
Have fun tonight.

00:08:28.46,00:08:29.61
Thanks. You too.

00:08:36.10,00:08:37.29
You said she was bald.

00:08:37.54,00:08:39.26
She was bald. She's not now.

00:08:41.26,00:08:43.05
How could you not tell me[br]she has hair?

00:08:43.30,00:08:46.05
I don't know.[br]I hardly ever say that about people.

00:08:46.30,00:08:48.05
Oh, well this is just perfect!

00:08:48.70,00:08:51.53
Well, I' m sorry.[br]I thought you said it was okay.

00:08:51.78,00:08:56.06
I said it was okay when I thought[br]she was some weird bald chick.

00:08:56.26,00:08:58.69
That girl has got hair[br]all over her head!

00:09:01.06,00:09:05.05
-Maybe Ross won't like her personality.[br]-Does she have a bad personality?

00:09:05.26,00:09:07.25
Oh, no, Bonnie's the best!

00:09:12.74,00:09:13.53
Bing!

00:09:15.66,00:09:18.49
Read your CompuTek proposal.[br]Real home run.

00:09:19.86,00:09:22.50
Barely got you that time.[br]Get over here!

00:09:23.34,00:09:24.13
Come on.

00:09:24.74,00:09:26.25
Oh, yeah! Good one.

00:09:26.50,00:09:28.93
That was a good one.[br]Keep at it, team!

00:09:30.46,00:09:32.10
-What is with him?[br]-"With him"?

00:09:32.34,00:09:34.65
You' re his favorite.[br]You' re his guy!

00:09:34.86,00:09:36.21
We never get smacked.

00:09:37.74,00:09:39.73
That's not true.[br]He smacked you once.

00:09:39.98,00:09:42.97
Not on purpose.[br]He ricocheted off you and got me.

00:09:43.30,00:09:46.18
I' m telling you,[br]I need some smacks.

00:09:46.74,00:09:48.57
I got a kid starting Dartmouth.

00:09:48.82,00:09:51.46
Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth?[br]Dartmouth sucks!

00:09:51.66,00:09:53.09
-You go to Dartmouth?[br]-No, sir.

00:09:53.34,00:09:54.82
There you go!

00:10:02.94,00:10:04.45
God, Ross! What is that?

00:10:04.70,00:10:06.26
The Ultimate Fighting Combo.

00:10:06.46,00:10:09.42
I saved 30 cents.[br]Plus, I get to keep the cup.

00:10:11.66,00:10:13.89
From New York City, New York. . .

00:10:14.14,00:10:18.10
. . .appearing in his Ultimate[br]Fighting Championship debut. . .

00:10:18.34,00:10:21.93
. . .he's known for his[br]confrontational business style!

00:10:23.06,00:10:26.37
Ladies and gentlemen, introducing. . .

00:10:26.58,00:10:28.97
. . .Pete Becker!

00:10:34.38,00:10:35.73
I love you, Pete!

00:10:39.66,00:10:43.54
And his opponent,[br]from Huntington Beach, California. . .

00:10:43.78,00:10:47.37
. . .he's a 300-pound[br]streetfighter. . .

00:10:47.86,00:10:50.17
. . .Tank Abbott!

00:11:02.50,00:11:03.29
Pete?

00:11:03.54,00:11:04.33
Pete?

00:11:04.70,00:11:06.85
-That guy's pretty huge.[br]-Don't worry.

00:11:07.10,00:11:09.45
I'll use his strength[br]and weight against him.

00:11:09.70,00:11:13.77
Well, then that guy is in serious,[br]serious trouble.

00:11:18.66,00:11:20.38
You go get him. Let's go!

00:11:21.66,00:11:23.30
Here we go, gentlemen.

00:11:23.54,00:11:24.81
Are you ready?

00:11:27.82,00:11:30.25
Are you ready?[br]Then let's get it on!

00:11:51.62,00:11:52.73
It's me.

00:11:53.62,00:11:55.26
Monica.

00:11:57.94,00:12:00.45
Can I just tell you how proud[br]I am of you?

00:12:00.66,00:12:04.49
It would be nice after hearing[br]20,000 people chant, "You suck! "

00:12:05.66,00:12:07.57
I thought you were nuts at first. . .

00:12:07.82,00:12:09.30
. . .but you did it.

00:12:09.66,00:12:12.57
Now you can just look back at this[br]with no regrets.

00:12:12.82,00:12:14.17
Look back?

00:12:14.94,00:12:16.73
You' re not gonna keep going?

00:12:17.10,00:12:20.65
Let me ask you a question:[br]Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?

00:12:22.66,00:12:24.30
Well, no. But--

00:12:24.54,00:12:27.69
I' m not gonna stop until I' m[br]the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

00:12:28.74,00:12:32.37
That guy stood on your neck[br]until you passed out.

00:12:33.14,00:12:34.78
Let me tell you a story.

00:12:35.62,00:12:39.77
When I set out to create MOSS 865,[br]do you think it happened overnight?

00:12:40.02,00:12:44.25
No. There was MOSS 1[br]that burned down my dad's garage.

00:12:44.50,00:12:48.25
There was MOSS 2 that would only[br]schedule appointments in January.

00:12:48.46,00:12:50.69
And 862 others that I learned from.

00:12:50.94,00:12:54.53
Just like I learned from this fight,[br]never to let a guy stand on my neck.

00:12:54.78,00:12:56.93
You didn't know that already?

00:12:58.34,00:13:00.29
Look, I' m gonna get better.

00:13:01.10,00:13:03.09
Okay? I promise you.

00:13:06.66,00:13:08.93
Just get a lot better.

00:13:09.34,00:13:10.66
Fast.

00:13:12.74,00:13:13.77
One other thing.

00:13:14.02,00:13:17.57
Hoshi thinks you being ringside[br]may have affected my concentration.

00:13:19.74,00:13:21.41
That was the problem.

00:13:27.74,00:13:30.49
-How long until Pete's fight?[br]-About five minutes.

00:13:30.74,00:13:32.38
They' re interviewing his opponent.

00:13:32.62,00:13:36.53
Apparently, he trains by going to lran[br]and pulling the arms off thieves.

00:13:37.86,00:13:39.93
-Hot dog?[br]-Four, please.

00:13:40.50,00:13:42.06
I' m really nervous.

00:13:42.94,00:13:43.97
Thank you.

00:13:46.14,00:13:49.13
So how did it go with Bonnie?

00:13:49.38,00:13:53.37
Oh, I gotta tell you,[br]I wasn't expecting to like her at all.

00:13:53.62,00:13:56.45
I actually wasn't expecting[br]to like anyone right now.

00:13:56.66,00:13:58.61
But she's really terrific.

00:13:58.90,00:13:59.77
It's too bad.

00:14:02.14,00:14:04.45
No, I' m saying I liked her.

00:14:04.70,00:14:06.53
There are other fish in the sea.

00:14:07.70,00:14:10.85
I think she's great, okay?[br]We' re going out again.

00:14:11.42,00:14:14.49
I hear you. Are you capable[br]of talking about anything else?

00:14:16.30,00:14:18.21
Which one's my turkey burger?

00:14:18.46,00:14:20.61
The one next to my foot.[br]Sorry.

00:14:21.54,00:14:23.69
-Fight's starting![br]-We'll be right in.

00:14:23.90,00:14:26.65
So did your boss try[br]to slap you again today?

00:14:26.86,00:14:28.26
Nine times.

00:14:29.06,00:14:30.62
I had to put on lotion.

00:14:32.70,00:14:35.50
But it'll be okay.[br]Tomorrow, I conduct an experiment.

00:14:35.74,00:14:39.53
And if all goes as planned,[br]my butt will be smack-free.

00:14:40.22,00:14:41.33
Fight's over!

00:14:46.70,00:14:48.10
Excuse me, Doug?

00:14:50.42,00:14:52.37
Hey there, sports fan!

00:14:52.74,00:14:55.09
Bing! You got those numbers for me?

00:14:55.30,00:14:57.13
No. I didn't do them.

00:14:57.38,00:14:59.17
You forgot?

00:14:59.42,00:15:01.77
No, I just didn't do them.

00:15:02.02,00:15:05.57
Instead, I hung out with some[br]friends and had a couple of beers.

00:15:05.82,00:15:08.38
So I certainly don't[br]deserve praise. verbal. . .

00:15:08.62,00:15:10.13
. . .or otherwise.

00:15:10.74,00:15:13.70
I got tanked myself last night.[br]Pretty dicey drive home.

00:15:13.94,00:15:16.29
Tappan Zee Bridge never looked smaller.

00:15:17.30,00:15:20.33
That's okay. You' re still[br]my number-one guy! Bing!

00:15:20.94,00:15:22.42
Doug!

00:15:23.30,00:15:27.58
I' m a little bit uncomfortable with[br]the way that you express yourself.

00:15:27.82,00:15:30.25
Is it the swearing?[br]ls it the constant swearing?

00:15:30.46,00:15:34.29
Because I gotta tell you, if it is,[br]you can just kiss my ass!

00:15:36.30,00:15:38.89
It's not about the swearing.[br]It's more about. . .

00:15:39.14,00:15:41.49
. . .the way that you occasionally. . .

00:15:41.74,00:15:45.09
. . .concentrate your enthusiasm. . .

00:15:46.30,00:15:47.78
. . .on my buttocks.

00:15:50.14,00:15:52.94
Don't get me wrong.[br]I appreciate the sentiment.

00:15:53.14,00:15:56.81
It's just that I have a rather[br]sensitive posterior.

00:15:58.58,00:16:01.73
And besides, it's making[br]all the other guys jealous.

00:16:01.94,00:16:05.77
Well, say no more. You know,[br]it takes guts to bring this up.

00:16:06.02,00:16:07.89
Bing, you' re okay.

00:16:17.74,00:16:21.17
Would you rather live in the[br]shirt pocket of a sweaty giant. . .

00:16:21.42,00:16:23.81
. . .or inside his shower drain?

00:16:25.74,00:16:26.93
Oh, my God.

00:16:27.50,00:16:29.45
Look. It's Ross and that girl.

00:16:32.66,00:16:36.97
Look at that! It's a line of ants![br]They' re working as a team!

00:16:38.90,00:16:42.86
Right. Oh, yeah. It looks[br]like Ross is breaking up with her.

00:16:43.10,00:16:44.50
I hope he lets her down easy.

00:16:44.74,00:16:47.57
Look at that! They are not[br]breaking up! Look at them!

00:16:47.82,00:16:50.70
You know what that is?[br]A second date, that's what that is.

00:16:51.30,00:16:53.53
Look, she just put her hand[br]on his thigh.

00:16:53.78,00:16:56.25
That's nothing.[br]She's very sexually aggressive.

00:16:56.46,00:16:57.49
Oh, God!

00:16:57.74,00:17:02.33
It's your fault. Now he loves her.[br]He'll marry her. It's all your fault.

00:17:03.02,00:17:04.45
You said it was okay.

00:17:04.70,00:17:06.73
You said she was bald!

00:17:08.14,00:17:10.37
Was! Was, was, was!

00:17:11.62,00:17:15.45
We can't let it happen. We have to do[br]something. We have to break them up.

00:17:15.70,00:17:19.74
Just go in there and shave her head![br]You owe me one bald girl!

00:17:21.50,00:17:23.22
Okay, first of all, breathe.

00:17:24.42,00:17:26.69
Second of all, I don't get it.

00:17:27.02,00:17:29.98
Aren't you the one that decided[br]you didn't want to be with Ross?

00:17:33.30,00:17:36.85
Well, isn't he your friend?[br]Don't you want him to be happy?

00:17:40.90,00:17:42.01
So?

00:17:46.10,00:17:50.41
It's just, you know, I didn't[br]expect him to be this happy so soon.

00:17:59.82,00:18:00.69
-Oh, no.[br]-What?

00:18:00.94,00:18:01.97
We killed them all!

00:18:17.54,00:18:20.29
It's not as bad as it looks.[br]It's a precaution.

00:18:20.54,00:18:22.93
I' m not supposed to move my spine.

00:18:25.34,00:18:27.13
Please tell me you' re stopping now.

00:18:27.50,00:18:30.14
I' m fine. I'd fight tonight[br]if they'd let me.

00:18:31.74,00:18:34.25
Now, see this circle[br]I' m marking off here?

00:18:34.46,00:18:36.37
This is my Zone of Terror.

00:18:39.02,00:18:42.25
You are insane![br]You've got to give this up!

00:18:42.46,00:18:45.26
I can't until I' m[br]the Ultimate Fighter.

00:18:45.46,00:18:46.57
I will do it.

00:18:46.82,00:18:50.89
The day will come when children will[br]argue over who will win a fight. . .

00:18:51.14,00:18:52.97
. . .me or Superman.

00:18:54.78,00:18:57.66
Not that I could beat Superman,[br]but kids are stupid.

00:18:58.86,00:19:00.05
Just sit down.

00:19:00.26,00:19:02.05
Please listen to me.

00:19:02.26,00:19:07.05
You are terrible at this, okay? You[br]are the worst Ultimate Fighter ever.

00:19:07.54,00:19:08.45
Ever!

00:19:09.82,00:19:13.70
I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline[br]fracture in my right forearm. . .

00:19:13.94,00:19:17.90
. . .and a severely bruised Adam's[br]apple, but that really hurt.

00:19:23.30,00:19:25.45
Well, then, you know what?

00:19:27.42,00:19:31.41
I care about you too much to watch you[br]hurt yourself like this.

00:19:31.90,00:19:35.17
So if you have to do this,[br]you'll have to do it without me.

00:19:35.66,00:19:37.49
If you' re asking me to quit. . .

00:19:37.74,00:19:40.46
. . .then you' re asking me[br]to be someone I' m not.

00:19:40.74,00:19:42.14
I've got to do this.

00:19:46.30,00:19:48.05
Then I've gotta go.

00:19:49.86,00:19:50.73
Bye.

00:19:58.74,00:20:00.77
Could you leave a note?[br]I' m on painkillers. . .

00:20:01.02,00:20:03.05
. . .and I might not[br]remember this tomorrow.

00:20:08.30,00:20:13.09
So, in conclusion, the lines[br]all go up, so I' m happy.

00:20:13.94,00:20:16.17
Great job, team![br]Tomorrow at 8:30.

00:20:16.74,00:20:19.70
Phil, nice job! Stevens, way to go!

00:20:19.90,00:20:22.05
Goldberg, you maniac!

00:20:22.26,00:20:23.77
I love you!

00:20:26.94,00:20:29.58
-Couldn't have done it without you.[br]-Thank you, sir.

00:20:29.82,00:20:31.05
Oh, excuse me.

00:20:31.26,00:20:34.85
I forgot my briefcase, you know,[br]by accident.

00:20:35.10,00:20:38.45
Of course, you did. Forgot[br]something else too, you bastard!

00:20:41.06,00:20:43.05
Well, what about you?

00:20:43.30,00:20:45.65
You' re not feeling left out, are you?

00:20:46.94,00:20:49.45
No, not at all. That's ridiculous.

00:20:49.66,00:20:52.77
Everybody else got one,[br]and you want one too. Don't you?

00:20:55.98,00:20:57.21
Yes, I do.

00:20:57.50,00:20:59.53
Now, get on out of here, you!

00:21:04.62,00:21:06.26
Pete Becker circles the ring.

00:21:06.50,00:21:08.85
Looks like he's just trying[br]to feel him out.

00:21:09.06,00:21:10.49
Bruiser is charging!

00:21:10.74,00:21:13.30
Run, you crazy, rich freak!

00:21:14.90,00:21:16.13
I can't watch this.

00:21:16.38,00:21:17.94
Check it out! Pete's winning!

00:21:18.18,00:21:19.25
Really?

00:21:22.54,00:21:26.74
Bruiser has Becker on the canvas[br]and is going for his favorite area!

00:21:28.46,00:21:32.25
Wait! lf that's his favorite area,[br]why is he being so mean to it?

00:21:32.90,00:21:34.09
This is ironic.

00:21:34.34,00:21:36.90
Your last boyfriend, Richard,[br]didn't want to have kids.

00:21:37.14,00:21:39.65
And from the looks of it,[br]now Pete can't.

00:21:54.69,00:21:58.52
So your first sexual experience[br]was with a woman?

00:21:59.33,00:22:01.84
I was 1 5.[br]It was my best friend, Ruth.

00:22:02.05,00:22:04.36
And we got drunk on that hard cider.

00:22:04.61,00:22:07.25
And then suddenly,[br]we were making out.

00:22:08.41,00:22:09.24
Tell it again.

00:22:12.81,00:22:13.60
Seriously.

00:22:16.61,00:22:19.07
Can that woman talk[br]about anything else but sex?

00:22:20.49,00:22:24.24
Yeah, sure. Earlier she was[br]talking about geography.

00:22:25.13,00:22:28.44
She was listing the countries[br]she's done it in.

00:22:30.25,00:22:32.08
I think we all[br]learned something.

00:22:33.65,00:22:35.76
Hey, you guys! Look what I found!

00:22:36.01,00:22:37.88
That's my mom's writing. Look.

00:22:38.33,00:22:41.84
"Me and Frank and Phoebe,[br]graduation, 1 965. "

00:22:42.05,00:22:45.32
-Do you know what that means?[br]-That you're actually 50?

00:22:46.05,00:22:48.69
That's not "me" Phoebe.[br]That's her pal, Phoebe.

00:22:48.93,00:22:51.20
According to her yearbook,[br]they were BFF.

00:22:52.81,00:22:54.00
Best Friends Forever.

00:22:54.93,00:22:55.96
That's great!

00:22:56.21,00:23:00.20
I know! She probably has all kinds[br]of stories about my parents.

00:23:00.41,00:23:02.08
She might know where my dad is.

00:23:02.29,00:23:04.28
I looked her up.[br]She lives by the beach.

00:23:04.53,00:23:06.56
Maybe this weekend we can[br]go there.

00:23:07.81,00:23:10.76
-Shoot, I can't go. I have to work.[br]-That's too bad.

00:23:11.45,00:23:13.00
Big fat bummer.

00:23:14.53,00:23:16.84
So tomorrow we'll drive out[br]to Montauk.

00:23:17.05,00:23:18.92
Hey, Bonnie had sex there!

00:23:21.25,00:23:23.40
The One At the Beach

00:23:24.61,00:23:25.60
English Subtitles by[br]GELULA & CO., INC.

00:24:11.61,00:24:13.04
Would you look at them?

00:24:14.13,00:24:16.16
I'm never gonna find[br]a boyfriend again.

00:24:16.41,00:24:18.64
I'm gonna die an old maid.

00:24:18.89,00:24:21.04
You're not gonna die an old maid.

00:24:21.25,00:24:23.71
Maybe an old spinster cook.

00:24:26.61,00:24:29.28
-Thanks.[br]-Besides, worse comes to worse. . .

00:24:29.49,00:24:31.24
. . .I'll be your boyfriend.

00:24:34.45,00:24:35.44
Yeah, right.

00:24:38.61,00:24:40.32
Why is that so funny?

00:24:40.57,00:24:42.48
You made a joke, right?

00:24:42.73,00:24:44.21
So I laughed.

00:24:46.73,00:24:48.16
A little too hard.

00:24:49.53,00:24:51.28
Am I not boyfriend material?

00:24:53.09,00:24:54.00
You're Chandler.

00:24:56.01,00:24:58.24
You know. Chandler!

00:24:58.69,00:25:01.60
Okay, so we've established[br]my name, and hit me.

00:25:02.49,00:25:05.08
But say we weren't friends.[br]Say it's a blind date.

00:25:05.33,00:25:09.68
I show up at your door and I'm,[br]like, "Hey, nice to meet you. "

00:25:11.21,00:25:15.04
I'd probably be scared of a guy[br]using a fake voice.

00:25:16.33,00:25:17.92
Oh, good. You bought food.

00:25:18.17,00:25:20.04
No, just my luggage.

00:25:27.13,00:25:29.36
I am having the best karma this week.

00:25:29.57,00:25:31.48
I find this woman[br]who knew my parents. . .

00:25:31.73,00:25:34.64
. . .and then my client[br]gives me his beach house.

00:25:34.85,00:25:37.49
What about that bike[br]messenger you hit?

00:25:37.73,00:25:40.00
Oh, I wasn't talking about his karma.

00:25:42.01,00:25:43.84
Hey, check out the hat!

00:25:47.09,00:25:48.92
Wait a minute, I know that hat.

00:25:49.61,00:25:51.09
I was taken aboard that hat.

00:25:52.65,00:25:54.52
They did experiments on me.

00:25:54.73,00:25:56.05
I can't have children!

00:25:57.41,00:25:59.44
Seriously, where did you get the hat?

00:25:59.69,00:26:00.84
Ross gave it to me.

00:26:01.09,00:26:03.16
I think she looks good.

00:26:04.25,00:26:05.76
Did he buy it for you. . .

00:26:06.25,00:26:07.52
. . .or win it for you?

00:26:09.01,00:26:11.28
Excuse me,[br]my fashion-impaired friends. . .

00:26:11.53,00:26:13.44
. . .I'm here to tell you[br]hats are back.

00:26:13.69,00:26:17.24
And this time, they've ganged up[br]and formed one giant super-hat.

00:26:23.37,00:26:24.16
Go, go, go!

00:26:24.37,00:26:26.48
Now everybody wants to be[br]under the hat!

00:26:33.93,00:26:35.48
What's with all this sand?

00:26:35.73,00:26:38.16
Bob said there might be flood damage.

00:26:38.41,00:26:40.52
Either that or he has[br]a really big cat.

00:26:45.37,00:26:47.16
It's kind of an unusual house.

00:26:47.41,00:26:51.04
It has three beautiful bedrooms[br]and no baths.

00:26:51.37,00:26:54.24
But, you know, the ocean[br]is right there.

00:26:55.01,00:26:56.04
Knock, knock, knock.

00:26:56.53,00:26:58.36
Hang on.[br]Come in, come in.

00:26:58.61,00:27:00.52
Think about it and call me back.

00:27:02.29,00:27:03.48
Are you Phoebe Abbott?

00:27:04.61,00:27:07.80
Surprise, Phoebe Abbott![br]I'm your best friend's daughter!

00:27:10.13,00:27:11.35
You're lrwin's daughter?

00:27:11.61,00:27:14.28
I mean your old best friend.[br]Here.

00:27:15.01,00:27:18.84
-Lily? From high school? Remember?[br]-Oh, God, Lily. Yes.

00:27:19.05,00:27:21.00
Of course I remember Lily.

00:27:22.89,00:27:23.72
Then you must be--

00:27:23.97,00:27:25.29
Phoebe, Phoebe.

00:27:26.93,00:27:29.12
She named me after you, I guess.

00:27:29.53,00:27:32.09
Wow. Well.[br]Look, there's Frank!

00:27:32.29,00:27:33.88
Yeah! Yes! Yes, yes!

00:27:34.13,00:27:36.24
That's my dad. That's Frank!

00:27:36.45,00:27:38.84
I'm sorry I'm getting all flingy.

00:27:39.45,00:27:41.68
Take it easy.[br]If you want, there's cookies.

00:27:41.93,00:27:44.65
Or sangria! I could make sangria!

00:27:44.89,00:27:46.80
Sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.

00:27:49.53,00:27:53.00
Anyway, I've been[br]looking for my father.

00:27:54.01,00:27:57.44
-Have you heard from him or seen him?[br]-Oh, no, I'm sorry.

00:27:57.65,00:28:00.84
I lost track of everybody[br]after high school.

00:28:03.41,00:28:07.04
Well, so tell me everything[br]about my parents. Everything.

00:28:07.25,00:28:10.28
Oh, well, you know,[br]we were always together.

00:28:10.53,00:28:13.84
-The other kids had a nickname for us.[br]-What was it?

00:28:14.05,00:28:15.48
The Three Losers.

00:28:16.33,00:28:17.65
Oh, poor Lily.

00:28:19.65,00:28:23.64
I heard what happened. That must[br]have been just terrible for you. . .

00:28:23.89,00:28:25.68
. . .Iosing your mother that way.

00:28:26.85,00:28:28.48
Yeah, no, it was great.

00:28:39.61,00:28:42.12
You know what a really good[br]rainy-day game is?

00:28:42.37,00:28:44.04
I mean, naked game.

00:28:45.05,00:28:46.84
We should play strip poker.

00:28:47.29,00:28:48.24
Are you crazy?

00:28:48.49,00:28:52.20
Come on. When you go away,[br]you have to play. It's, like, a law.

00:28:53.61,00:28:55.16
-All done.[br]-Thank you.

00:28:55.41,00:28:57.12
Okay. Who's next?

00:29:01.73,00:29:02.95
No way!

00:29:03.17,00:29:07.16
Come on, please. I'm bored.[br]You let me do it once before.

00:29:11.33,00:29:14.44
Well, if that's the rule[br]this weekend. . . .

00:29:16.33,00:29:19.12
-Get away.[br]-Take it like a man. Come on!

00:29:21.01,00:29:22.00
Big bullies!

00:29:35.49,00:29:36.64
How are we doing?

00:29:36.89,00:29:38.44
Bored and bored.

00:29:39.93,00:29:42.88
You know what naked card game's[br]never boring?

00:29:45.25,00:29:46.84
So what's Phoebe like?

00:29:47.13,00:29:50.24
I'm kind, caring and sweet.[br]What's Monica like?

00:29:51.73,00:29:54.08
No, the other Phoebe.[br]The one you went to see?

00:29:54.33,00:29:56.89
I think she knows where my dad is!

00:29:57.09,00:29:57.96
Cool!

00:29:58.21,00:29:59.00
Where is he?

00:29:59.21,00:30:02.04
She was pretending she hasn't[br]heard from him. . .

00:30:02.29,00:30:04.28
. . .but I found this picture.

00:30:04.53,00:30:06.84
Isn't this what he would[br]look like now?

00:30:07.61,00:30:08.44
Totally familiar.

00:30:11.97,00:30:13.08
Why would she lie to you?

00:30:13.33,00:30:16.44
We're having dinner tomorrow.[br]Maybe she'll tell me then.

00:30:16.65,00:30:18.88
Maybe she just wanted[br]to give him time. . .

00:30:19.13,00:30:21.04
. . .to buy me presents.[br]I don't know.

00:30:22.37,00:30:24.04
So you're all bored?

00:30:25.09,00:30:28.36
I'll close my eyes and point[br]to someone. Whoever it is. . .

00:30:28.61,00:30:31.84
. . .has to think of something[br]fun to do. And we have to do it.

00:30:32.09,00:30:33.80
Okay! Fan out! Fan out!

00:30:37.49,00:30:39.52
You know, we could just do this!

00:30:43.65,00:30:45.72
We all have to play strip poker?

00:30:49.09,00:30:50.44
Strip Happy Days Game?

00:30:51.45,00:30:56.36
I couldn't find cards, so it was this[br]or Strip Bag-Of-Old-Knitting-Stuff.

00:30:57.33,00:30:58.36
Done.

00:31:00.41,00:31:05.04
"Fonzie gives you two thumbs up.[br]Collect two cool points. "

00:31:06.33,00:31:09.72
Get five points, you get to make[br]someone take off one item of clothing.

00:31:09.97,00:31:12.43
It hasn't happened yet,[br]but we're very excited.

00:31:13.53,00:31:14.72
Okay, come on.

00:31:15.25,00:31:20.16
Daddy needs a new electromagnetic[br]microscope for Prehistoric Forensics.

00:31:25.41,00:31:29.52
"Take Pinky Tuscadero up[br]to lnspiration Point.

00:31:29.77,00:31:31.84
Collect three cool points. " Yeah!

00:31:32.05,00:31:33.68
Which gives me five.

00:31:33.93,00:31:36.57
And let's see, who is gonna lose[br]their clothes?

00:31:37.69,00:31:41.00
I think I pick our strip poker[br]sponsor, Mr. Joey Tribbiani.

00:31:44.57,00:31:46.68
All right, relax. It's just a shoe.

00:31:49.29,00:31:53.44
"Your band is playing at Arnold's.[br]Collect three cool points. "

00:31:53.69,00:31:58.44
Which means I have five and[br]that means I get Joey's boxers.

00:32:04.53,00:32:06.04
Fine. Gang up on me.

00:32:06.29,00:32:08.93
I got you all,[br]right where I want you.

00:32:09.41,00:32:11.08
Come on! Take them off!

00:32:11.33,00:32:12.84
Actually, it's kind of cold.

00:32:13.05,00:32:16.40
What if I keep them on and[br]give you a peek at the good stuff?

00:32:16.89,00:32:18.88
I'm gonna make more margaritas.

00:32:19.13,00:32:21.96
What are you doing?[br]Trying to get me drunk?

00:32:22.25,00:32:24.40
I'm just making margaritas.

00:32:25.69,00:32:27.20
Think I'll help her out.

00:32:30.89,00:32:32.11
What is going on here?

00:32:32.33,00:32:33.24
What?

00:32:33.49,00:32:36.84
You're painting his toenails.[br]Chasing him around the room.

00:32:37.05,00:32:38.04
Monica, please.

00:32:38.29,00:32:40.24
He's totally flirting with you too.

00:32:41.33,00:32:42.55
He is, isn't he?

00:32:44.13,00:32:48.09
I don't know. Maybe it's just[br]being here at the beach together. . .

00:32:48.33,00:32:49.73
. . .but it's like something--

00:32:55.21,00:32:56.00
Hi, Bonnie.

00:32:57.21,00:32:59.85
My boss let me off early,[br]so I took the train.

00:33:00.05,00:33:01.32
What are you guys doing?

00:33:01.57,00:33:03.96
We're playing Strip Happy Days Game.

00:33:05.01,00:33:06.52
Cool! I'll catch up!

00:33:15.65,00:33:18.32
So you still don't think. . .

00:33:18.61,00:33:20.24
. . .I'm boyfriend material?

00:33:22.29,00:33:25.28
I saw you checking me out[br]during the game last night.

00:33:25.73,00:33:27.64
You didn't even take off your pants.

00:33:27.89,00:33:28.72
Lucky for you.

00:33:30.65,00:33:32.20
-What?[br]-I don't know.

00:33:33.81,00:33:37.72
Well, is everybody else having[br]just the best time?

00:33:39.01,00:33:40.16
Joey's asleep.

00:33:49.73,00:33:52.84
He passed out. We put sand[br]around him to keep him warm.

00:33:55.73,00:33:59.08
Well, I assume the happy couple[br]isn't up yet?

00:33:59.33,00:34:01.52
Did you guys hear them last night?

00:34:01.81,00:34:05.96
I don't know what they were doing,[br]but sea turtles came up to the house.

00:34:08.33,00:34:09.44
Good morning.

00:34:10.33,00:34:11.65
-How'd you sleep?[br]-Great.

00:34:11.89,00:34:12.68
Like a log.

00:34:12.93,00:34:14.20
Us too.

00:34:16.21,00:34:17.24
I'm going for a walk.

00:34:22.69,00:34:25.48
Good morning.[br]Nice breasts by the way.

00:34:35.89,00:34:37.44
Hey, what happened to you?

00:34:37.65,00:34:40.92
Oh, nothing. I just felt like[br]hanging out and reading.

00:34:41.53,00:34:45.57
The water was so great. We jumped[br]off this pier and my suit came off.

00:34:47.09,00:34:48.44
Sorry I missed that.

00:34:48.65,00:34:50.72
Joey and Chandler sure are funny.

00:34:53.01,00:34:55.24
I brought back half the beach[br]in my hair.

00:34:55.49,00:34:57.48
It was easier when I shaved my head.

00:35:02.25,00:35:04.24
You know, I gotta tell you. . .

00:35:04.45,00:35:07.28
. . .I just loved your look[br]when you were bald.

00:35:07.93,00:35:09.12
Really?

00:35:09.93,00:35:12.49
I think about shaving it[br]again sometimes.

00:35:13.05,00:35:14.16
Really?

00:35:15.21,00:35:16.80
You definitely should do that.

00:35:17.93,00:35:19.84
You know what? I should do it!

00:35:20.09,00:35:22.68
You know what? Thank you.[br]You are so cool.

00:35:22.93,00:35:24.72
Oh, stop. Go on.

00:35:25.25,00:35:27.64
-Now go shave that head.[br]-All right.

00:35:38.73,00:35:40.05
What's the matter?

00:35:40.25,00:35:42.89
She canceled.[br]My namesake canceled on me.

00:35:43.13,00:35:46.44
She claims she had to go out of town.[br]She's avoiding me.

00:35:46.69,00:35:50.04
She doesn't want to tell me[br]where my father is. She knows!

00:35:50.29,00:35:52.32
Pheebs, that sucks.

00:35:53.45,00:35:56.24
Well, don't[br]"Pheebs, that sucks" me yet.

00:35:57.25,00:35:59.64
-Where are you going?[br]-She's out of town.

00:35:59.89,00:36:02.48
Something in her house[br]will tell me where he is.

00:36:02.85,00:36:05.84
Some people call that[br]"breaking and entering. "

00:36:06.29,00:36:08.64
Well, are any of those people here?

00:36:09.89,00:36:12.20
Look, I'll do something nice, okay?

00:36:13.45,00:36:15.44
I'll fill her ice trays. Good?

00:36:17.37,00:36:18.32
Hey, everybody!

00:36:23.93,00:36:25.08
Look what you did!

00:36:26.85,00:36:27.96
You wanna touch it?

00:36:28.17,00:36:30.12
No, but it's great.

00:36:30.37,00:36:31.88
Come on, touch it.

00:36:36.01,00:36:38.92
You can feel all the bones[br]in your skull.

00:36:47.29,00:36:51.36
I was having a little chat[br]with Bonnie, and guess what?

00:36:51.61,00:36:54.72
She brought up who was[br]behind the head-shaving idea.

00:36:54.97,00:36:57.64
And now, who was it?[br]Oh, that's right. It was you!

00:36:59.41,00:37:01.28
That was her idea.

00:37:01.53,00:37:04.20
I just gave her a nudge.

00:37:04.45,00:37:06.64
She said you gave her the razor.

00:37:09.21,00:37:11.24
So anyone up for a midnight dip?

00:37:11.49,00:37:13.48
-No, I'm good.[br]-No, thanks.

00:37:13.73,00:37:16.64
-Okay, I'll see you in a bit.[br]-Okay, have fun.

00:37:17.93,00:37:21.04
Come on, see?[br]She doesn't look that bad.

00:37:21.81,00:37:24.88
You can see the moonlight[br]bouncing off her head!

00:37:26.41,00:37:27.68
What were you thinking?

00:37:27.93,00:37:29.08
I don't know.

00:37:29.33,00:37:30.92
You balded my girlfriend!

00:37:31.17,00:37:32.12
All right.

00:37:34.21,00:37:37.32
Do you think it's easy for me[br]to see you with somebody else?

00:37:37.57,00:37:39.48
You're the one who ended it!

00:37:39.73,00:37:43.56
Because I was mad at you![br]Not because I stopped loving you!

00:37:44.69,00:37:45.84
You still love me?

00:37:49.33,00:37:50.24
You still love me.

00:37:51.29,00:37:52.28
Yeah, so?

00:37:52.53,00:37:53.52
You love me.

00:37:58.69,00:38:00.04
What does this mean?

00:38:00.25,00:38:02.89
I mean, do you want[br]to get back together?

00:38:03.13,00:38:04.88
No! Maybe!

00:38:05.73,00:38:07.21
I don't know.

00:38:12.85,00:38:16.04
I still can't forgive you[br]for what you did.

00:38:16.53,00:38:19.36
But sometimes when I'm with you,[br]I just feel so. . . .

00:38:19.81,00:38:20.80
What?

00:38:21.93,00:38:23.44
I just feel. . . .

00:38:25.25,00:38:27.52
-I just--[br]-What?

00:38:28.01,00:38:28.80
I feel--

00:38:37.09,00:38:38.68
No! I don't care!

00:38:38.93,00:38:42.81
I'm not playing one-on-one strip poker[br]with you for practice!

00:38:43.13,00:38:45.08
But I made cards!

00:38:48.09,00:38:49.08
Good night.

00:38:50.05,00:38:51.60
I'm going upstairs.

00:38:52.13,00:38:53.84
-Good night.[br]-Good night.

00:39:00.53,00:39:02.84
Wanna play strip poker[br]for practice?

00:39:19.65,00:39:20.76
My ass!

00:39:58.49,00:39:59.89
Oh, it's me! It's me!

00:40:00.13,00:40:03.00
-I didn't wanna make any noise![br]-Then don't break in!

00:40:04.81,00:40:07.20
-I'm sorry![br]-What are you doing here?

00:40:07.73,00:40:11.24
I came to fill your ice cube tray.

00:40:12.45,00:40:13.32
What?

00:40:16.73,00:40:18.28
Okay, look.

00:40:19.69,00:40:23.47
I took this picture from your fridge.[br]I know that this is my father.

00:40:23.73,00:40:26.92
This is Frank Buffay, and you were[br]standing next to him!

00:40:27.49,00:40:29.76
I deserve to know where I came from.

00:40:30.01,00:40:33.04
So if you can help me find my father,[br]then you should.

00:40:33.25,00:40:35.36
Otherwise, you're just mean.

00:40:37.69,00:40:39.76
So just tell me the truth.

00:40:40.21,00:40:41.28
All right.

00:40:42.09,00:40:45.97
The man in that picture[br]is Chuck Mangione.

00:40:48.01,00:40:50.44
My father is Chuck Mangione?

00:40:50.89,00:40:52.56
That's just Chuck Mangione.

00:40:52.81,00:40:55.04
I sold him a house last year.

00:40:55.25,00:40:59.13
And I'm very sorry, but I really don't[br]know where your father is.

00:40:59.33,00:41:01.04
And that's the truth.

00:41:03.13,00:41:04.88
But you're right.

00:41:06.05,00:41:08.84
I think a person should know[br]where they come from.

00:41:09.53,00:41:11.40
Which is why l. . . .

00:41:20.13,00:41:21.56
I'm your mother.

00:41:26.61,00:41:29.64
I wanted to tell you[br]yesterday, but I just. . .

00:41:29.89,00:41:31.60
. . .felt all floopy, and. . . .

00:41:34.69,00:41:36.76
You guys are getting back together.

00:41:37.09,00:41:39.16
She doesn't even know what she wants.

00:41:39.41,00:41:41.32
Rachel's still mad at me.

00:41:41.57,00:41:44.68
Then you gotta back away.[br]You don't need that kind of hurt.

00:41:44.93,00:41:46.52
Take it from a guy who's. . .

00:41:46.97,00:41:49.88
. . .never had a long-term relationship.

00:41:50.85,00:41:55.16
I know, but I really want to go[br]up there and finish that kiss.

00:41:57.41,00:41:59.68
The water is great.[br]You should go in.

00:41:59.93,00:42:02.24
No, thanks. I just had an M&M.

00:42:03.53,00:42:04.36
Well, good night.

00:42:04.61,00:42:05.56
Good night.

00:42:06.89,00:42:07.88
Don't be too long.

00:42:08.13,00:42:09.48
Okey-dokey.

00:42:11.01,00:42:13.24
There is not one hair on that head.

00:42:13.49,00:42:17.88
It'll grow back, right?[br]And she's really fun, and she's cool.

00:42:18.13,00:42:19.88
And I'm finally moving on.

00:42:20.13,00:42:22.64
Getting over Rachel was so--

00:42:23.85,00:42:26.84
I'm finally feeling sane.[br]And if I go up there. . .

00:42:27.05,00:42:28.64
. . .and I kiss her. . . .

00:42:28.89,00:42:30.64
God, I want to kiss her!

00:42:31.53,00:42:35.16
And it doesn't work out. Do I wanna[br]put myself through that again?

00:42:35.41,00:42:36.68
Let me get this straight.

00:42:36.89,00:42:41.56
If you go with Bonnie, you do the[br]smart, healthy thing and move on.

00:42:41.81,00:42:45.12
Right? And if you go with Rachel,[br]Bonnie's free tonight?

00:43:09.13,00:43:09.96
Hi there.

00:43:11.81,00:43:13.96
That's that weird voice again.

00:43:14.21,00:43:15.43
Let me try it again.

00:43:15.65,00:43:18.24
You'll wanna date this next guy,[br]I swear!

00:43:23.57,00:43:24.92
