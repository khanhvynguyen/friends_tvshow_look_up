1
00:00:04,612 --> 00:00:05,727
Okay, this is it.

2
00:00:06,572 --> 00:00:07,971
You sure you wanna do this?

3
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,162
Hello, Mrs. Ross.

4
00:00:14,412 --> 00:00:17,449
Well, hello, Mr. Rachel.

5
00:00:24,332 --> 00:00:27,051
-Whoa!
-Oh, my God!

6
00:00:28,052 --> 00:00:29,690
Come on, Pheebs, hurry!

7
00:00:29,892 --> 00:00:31,723
Okay! Okay!

8
00:00:33,692 --> 00:00:36,365
Oh, my God!
ls everybody getting married?

9
00:00:39,052 --> 00:00:40,929
No running in the chapel.

10
00:00:41,132 --> 00:00:43,930
Hey, don't you give me
any of your-- Hey!

11
00:00:45,732 --> 00:00:46,847
Why are you here?

12
00:00:47,052 --> 00:00:50,089
Ross and Rachel left a message.
They're getting married.

13
00:00:50,332 --> 00:00:54,450
-Isn't that why you guys are here?
-Yes. Why else would we be here?

14
00:00:57,332 --> 00:00:59,084
What happened?
Did we miss it?

15
00:00:59,332 --> 00:01:00,606
We missed it.

16
00:01:00,812 --> 00:01:03,849
Maybe you wouldn't have
if you could run in the chapel!

17
00:01:04,892 --> 00:01:06,041
This is insane.

18
00:01:06,252 --> 00:01:09,130
What's the big deal?
It's not like it's a real marriage.

19
00:01:09,692 --> 00:01:11,045
What?

20
00:01:12,052 --> 00:01:14,885
If you marry in Vegas,
you're only married in Vegas.

21
00:01:17,132 --> 00:01:19,726
If you marry here,
you're married everywhere.

22
00:01:19,932 --> 00:01:21,047
Really?

23
00:01:21,652 --> 00:01:22,641
Yeah.

24
00:01:23,532 --> 00:01:25,250
Oh, my God!

25
00:01:26,332 --> 00:01:27,321
Oh, well.

26
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,924

28
00:02:41,212 --> 00:02:42,611
Why are we in bed together?

29
00:02:42,812 --> 00:02:44,040
I don't know.

30
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:48,089
Do you have any clothes on?

31
00:02:49,092 --> 00:02:50,081
Yes.

32
00:02:50,292 --> 00:02:51,281
-Really?
-No.

33
00:02:54,932 --> 00:02:56,445
But we didn't have. . .

34
00:02:58,332 --> 00:03:00,482
. . .sex, did we?

35
00:03:02,332 --> 00:03:04,721
I don't remember much
about last night.

36
00:03:04,932 --> 00:03:08,129
It was such a blur.

37
00:03:09,692 --> 00:03:12,490
I remember laughing.
I laughed a lot.

38
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,045
Then we didn't have sex.

39
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:22,042
Oh, I mean,
we were really drunk.

40
00:03:22,252 --> 00:03:23,924
I'm glad we didn't
do anything stupid.

41
00:03:24,132 --> 00:03:25,645
Tell me about it.

42
00:03:30,892 --> 00:03:32,245
Morning, Pheebs.

43
00:03:33,052 --> 00:03:36,169
Well, my movie has been
officially canceled.

44
00:03:37,052 --> 00:03:38,849
Joey, I'm so sorry.

45
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,246
You want my breakfast?

46
00:03:41,132 --> 00:03:42,850
Too depressed to eat.

47
00:03:43,052 --> 00:03:45,327
I'll probably eat in, like,
five minutes.

48
00:03:46,212 --> 00:03:49,090
I'll fly home with you.
What time is your flight?

49
00:03:49,292 --> 00:03:51,760
-What about my cab?
-I don't need that anymore.

50
00:03:52,812 --> 00:03:55,406
You borrowed my cab.
You have to drive it back.

51
00:03:55,612 --> 00:03:58,570
I don't wanna drive back
by myself. I get lonely.

52
00:03:58,812 --> 00:04:01,167
How about if you come with me?

53
00:04:01,372 --> 00:04:03,647
-It's a long trip.
-That would be great.

54
00:04:03,852 --> 00:04:06,082
We could talk and play games.

55
00:04:06,332 --> 00:04:10,041
This could be our chance
to, like, renew our friendship.

56
00:04:10,932 --> 00:04:13,446
Are you asking me
to have a "frienaissance"?

57
00:04:15,452 --> 00:04:16,487
Sure?

58
00:04:17,012 --> 00:04:21,449
All right, although I don't think we
need one. I never stopped loving you.

59
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:28,249
So has anybody talked
to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?

60
00:04:28,452 --> 00:04:30,727
They left me a message.
They'll be here.

61
00:04:30,932 --> 00:04:33,446
Where is the waitress? I'm starving.

62
00:04:35,732 --> 00:04:37,450
It's a buffet, man.

63
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:41,007
Here's where I win
all my money back!

64
00:04:43,532 --> 00:04:44,726
I gotta talk to you.

65
00:04:44,932 --> 00:04:45,921
Sure.

66
00:04:46,132 --> 00:04:47,247
What's up?

67
00:04:55,612 --> 00:04:57,568
Monica and I almost got married.

68
00:04:57,852 --> 00:04:59,126
My God!

69
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,243
That's huge!

70
00:05:02,932 --> 00:05:05,321
Wait a minute. Why wasn't I invited?

71
00:05:06,252 --> 00:05:10,325
And who was gonna be your best man?
Don't say Ross. Do not say Ross.

72
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:14,686
I just don't think that Monica and I
are ready yet. I love her. . .

73
00:05:14,932 --> 00:05:18,242
. . .but seeing Ross and Rachel
come out of that chapel. . .

74
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:23,242
. . .was like a wake-up call that Monica
and I are moving so fast, you know.

75
00:05:23,932 --> 00:05:26,048
How do I tell her
without crushing her?

76
00:05:28,652 --> 00:05:30,847
Tell her she's not marriage material.

77
00:05:33,052 --> 00:05:34,041
What?

78
00:05:35,412 --> 00:05:37,528
Girls say it to me all the time.

79
00:05:39,612 --> 00:05:43,241
And if she's anything like me,
she's just gonna be relieved.

80
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:47,248
How do I tell him that it's too soon?

81
00:05:47,452 --> 00:05:49,761
He's gonna think
I don't love him anymore.

82
00:05:49,972 --> 00:05:52,167
-Well, you don't.
-Yes, I do.

83
00:05:52,372 --> 00:05:54,203
Good. I was just testing you.

84
00:05:55,732 --> 00:05:57,450
-Hey.
-Oh, hi.

85
00:05:57,652 --> 00:05:59,688
We were just talking about bacon.

86
00:05:59,932 --> 00:06:02,048
No, we were talking about tennis.

87
00:06:02,252 --> 00:06:04,402
Tennis is more believable.

88
00:06:09,492 --> 00:06:11,050
Thank you.

89
00:06:12,412 --> 00:06:14,050
Coffee.

90
00:06:21,892 --> 00:06:22,688
What?

91
00:06:22,892 --> 00:06:25,884
Are we gonna talk about
what you guys did last night?

92
00:06:27,932 --> 00:06:31,242
What do you mean "Iast night"?
Nothing happened last night.

93
00:06:31,932 --> 00:06:34,446
Ross invited us all to watch.

94
00:06:37,092 --> 00:06:39,652
We weren't gonna miss
our friends marrying.

95
00:06:39,852 --> 00:06:41,649
Who got married?

96
00:06:43,732 --> 00:06:45,085
You did.

97
00:06:45,812 --> 00:06:47,325
What?

98
00:06:48,092 --> 00:06:51,641
-Hello. We didn't get married.
-No, we didn't. That's ridi--

99
00:06:56,252 --> 00:06:59,050
Wait, wait, wait.
I remember being in a chapel.

100
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,562
They would not let us get married
when we were that drunk.

101
00:07:02,772 --> 00:07:04,728
They let you get married.

102
00:07:04,932 --> 00:07:07,048
Most people who marry
in Vegas are drunk.

103
00:07:08,412 --> 00:07:10,243
Now, I'm drunk right now.

104
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:15,641
I can't have a mimosa with breakfast?
I'm on vacation.

105
00:07:16,172 --> 00:07:17,400
What are you gonna do?

106
00:07:17,612 --> 00:07:19,921
Well, I guess we find
a divorce lawyer.

107
00:07:20,132 --> 00:07:23,124
Well, I think, I think
Ross already has one.

108
00:07:25,772 --> 00:07:29,651
Now, this one's free, right?
Because you paid for the first two.

109
00:07:30,292 --> 00:07:32,442
Laugh it up, but the joke's on you. . .

110
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:35,041
. . .because we don't need
to get divorced.

111
00:07:35,252 --> 00:07:37,971
-We're just gonna get an annulment.
-An annulment?

112
00:07:38,172 --> 00:07:41,244
Ross, I don't think surgery
is the answer here.

113
00:07:43,612 --> 00:07:45,443
Oh, that's your thing!

114
00:07:46,412 --> 00:07:47,447
What?

115
00:07:48,492 --> 00:07:51,404
Your thing, that you're the guy
who gets divorced.

116
00:07:53,212 --> 00:07:55,567
No, no, that's not "my thing. "

117
00:07:56,252 --> 00:07:58,208
I do not love getting divorced.

118
00:07:58,732 --> 00:08:01,644
Yes, you do. This is
your third divorce.

119
00:08:01,852 --> 00:08:05,322
You love divorce so much,
you're probably gonna marry it. . .

120
00:08:07,332 --> 00:08:10,847
. . .and then it won't work out,
so you're gonna have to divorce it.

121
00:08:12,532 --> 00:08:13,806
I'm so drunk.

122
00:08:21,092 --> 00:08:23,481
-So what should we do?
-I don't know.

123
00:08:23,692 --> 00:08:25,284
I know I love you.

124
00:08:25,492 --> 00:08:27,050
I know I love you.

125
00:08:31,892 --> 00:08:34,167
Where are we on the whole
"going back. . .

126
00:08:34,372 --> 00:08:37,250
. . .to where they have the marriages"
thing? I love you.

127
00:08:38,052 --> 00:08:39,644
That's a good question.

128
00:08:40,452 --> 00:08:42,488
Last night we let the dice decide.

129
00:08:42,692 --> 00:08:45,604
We should leave it
up to fate again. I love you!

130
00:08:46,052 --> 00:08:48,282
We don't get married
unless there's a sign.

131
00:08:48,492 --> 00:08:50,050
So say. . . .

132
00:08:50,252 --> 00:08:52,686
You roll another eight,
then there's a sign. . .

133
00:08:52,892 --> 00:08:54,086
. . .that we should marry.

134
00:08:54,292 --> 00:08:55,805
Eight we get married. . .

135
00:08:56,012 --> 00:09:00,164
. . .but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 1 0,
1 1 , 1 2, we don't get married.

136
00:09:00,372 --> 00:09:01,441
Sounds great.

137
00:09:01,892 --> 00:09:03,450
Hey, we got a shooter.

138
00:09:03,692 --> 00:09:04,761
Money, please.

139
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:06,081
-Ready?
-Ready.

140
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:08,044
Come on, eight.

141
00:09:11,212 --> 00:09:12,930
Yes, yes, eight.

142
00:09:15,092 --> 00:09:16,650
Eight, easy eight.

143
00:09:19,732 --> 00:09:23,042
-I can't believe I rolled an eight.
-That was so unlikely.

144
00:09:24,652 --> 00:09:25,687
Let's get married.

145
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:27,445
I guess.

146
00:09:28,252 --> 00:09:30,607
Last night I rolled a hard eight.

147
00:09:30,812 --> 00:09:33,565
It was the wrong kind of eight.
No wedding! Damn it!

148
00:09:35,012 --> 00:09:36,286
I wanted it so bad!

149
00:09:39,652 --> 00:09:40,641
Wanna go pack?

150
00:09:43,772 --> 00:09:45,171
We're doing the right thing.

151
00:09:45,372 --> 00:09:46,851
Of course we are.

152
00:09:47,052 --> 00:09:48,804
We left it up to fate.

153
00:09:49,012 --> 00:09:52,448
If we were supposed to get married,
there would be a sign.

154
00:09:59,652 --> 00:10:03,850
Okay, you have 1 9 questions left.
Use them wisely.

155
00:10:07,532 --> 00:10:11,650
Come on, Joey. You can't win
if you don't ask any questions!

156
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:14,208
What?

157
00:10:14,412 --> 00:10:16,130
You promised me a fun road trip.

158
00:10:16,332 --> 00:10:19,927
We've been on the road for 6 hours,
and you've been asleep for 5 1 /2.

159
00:10:20,132 --> 00:10:23,249
We are switching, and
you are going to drive back.

160
00:10:23,452 --> 00:10:27,127
That will be your punishment,
you greedy sleeper!

161
00:10:28,052 --> 00:10:29,087
All right.

162
00:10:29,292 --> 00:10:32,045
And until then, you are going
to sing to me.

163
00:10:32,252 --> 00:10:36,450
Because the radio's broken, and you are
selfish, but you have a nice voice.

164
00:10:37,492 --> 00:10:38,527
-Really?
-Sing!

165
00:10:38,732 --> 00:10:43,647
I wanna rock 'n ' roll all night

166
00:10:50,932 --> 00:10:53,048
Man, this is a long drive.

167
00:10:54,732 --> 00:10:56,051
Are my eyes open?

168
00:10:56,252 --> 00:10:57,446
No!

169
00:11:12,852 --> 00:11:13,648
Morning.

170
00:11:20,572 --> 00:11:21,368
Hey.

171
00:11:21,572 --> 00:11:22,721
Hey, hubby.

172
00:11:26,412 --> 00:11:30,530
Actually, I wanted to talk to you
about that whole annulment thing.

173
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,688
Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.

174
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,845
Okay.

175
00:11:46,612 --> 00:11:49,251
So we'll just stay married.

176
00:11:49,452 --> 00:11:50,680
Yes, exactly.

177
00:11:50,892 --> 00:11:54,521
And I will make everyone
call me Mrs. Geller.

178
00:11:56,052 --> 00:11:57,610
Wow, this is so amazing.

179
00:11:57,812 --> 00:12:01,521
I really thought I'd have to
talk you into this more.

180
00:12:02,492 --> 00:12:06,246
Now I'm scared because I don't
actually think you're kidding.

181
00:12:07,692 --> 00:12:09,330
I'm not kidding.

182
00:12:09,532 --> 00:12:10,965
Look. . .

183
00:12:11,172 --> 00:12:14,244
. . .I can't have three
failed marriages.

184
00:12:14,452 --> 00:12:15,965
I can't, okay?

185
00:12:16,172 --> 00:12:19,244
I am not gonna be that guy.

186
00:12:22,892 --> 00:12:25,326
So what, we just
stay married forever?

187
00:12:27,092 --> 00:12:29,970
How is this going
to affect you, really?

188
00:12:32,532 --> 00:12:35,649
I mean, you fill some form out
once in a while. . .

189
00:12:35,852 --> 00:12:39,845
. . .instead of checking the box "Miss,"
you check the box that says, "Mrs. "

190
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:42,850
It's right next to it.

191
00:12:44,852 --> 00:12:47,446
Okay. I'm sorry, you're right.
You know what?

192
00:12:47,652 --> 00:12:49,324
We can stay married. . .

193
00:12:49,532 --> 00:12:53,923
. . .because I thought that the boxes
were far away from each other.

194
00:12:56,012 --> 00:12:56,888
All right.

195
00:12:57,092 --> 00:12:58,491
Look, just. . .

196
00:12:58,692 --> 00:13:00,569
. . .please take a moment here. . .

197
00:13:00,772 --> 00:13:03,570
. . .and think about what
you're asking of me. Okay?

198
00:13:04,292 --> 00:13:08,649
I am asking you to do me a favor.

199
00:13:10,732 --> 00:13:14,361
You are asking me to be your wife.

200
00:13:14,572 --> 00:13:19,282
And, as my wife, I think
you should grant me this favor.

201
00:13:23,252 --> 00:13:25,083
That kid kicked me really hard.

202
00:13:25,292 --> 00:13:27,169
Well, you did pull his hair.

203
00:13:27,812 --> 00:13:30,610
-He took my snack.
-I'm not getting into this again.

204
00:13:30,812 --> 00:13:33,280
All right, you know what?
Hurts really bad.

205
00:13:33,492 --> 00:13:35,448
Well, I told you not to walk. Here.

206
00:13:35,652 --> 00:13:37,051
There. There. Okay.

207
00:13:46,212 --> 00:13:48,646
-This doesn't mean anything, does it?
-No.

208
00:13:52,412 --> 00:13:54,403
How could you pick up a hitchhiker?

209
00:13:54,612 --> 00:13:59,049
He could be a rape-- He could be
a rapist or a killer or something.

210
00:13:59,252 --> 00:14:01,846
Don't you think I asked him that
before he got in?

211
00:14:02,492 --> 00:14:05,211
I'm not talking to you.
You go back to sleep.

212
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:06,765
And, you, are you a rapist?

213
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:07,768
No.

214
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,610
Do you like car games?

215
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,968
Yeah, you know
the license plate game?

216
00:14:12,172 --> 00:14:13,810
I love the license plate game!

217
00:14:14,492 --> 00:14:15,845
I'll play. I'll play.

218
00:14:16,052 --> 00:14:18,008
No, you need your sleep.
Night-night.

219
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:28,087
Listen. I know you wanted
to talk to me. . .

220
00:14:28,292 --> 00:14:31,728
. . .but I have an idea that may
make you wanna stay married.

221
00:14:33,492 --> 00:14:35,130
We register. . .

222
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:37,971
. . .and you get to keep
all the presents.

223
00:14:42,012 --> 00:14:44,446
No, Ross, come on. No, listen.

224
00:14:44,652 --> 00:14:46,847
I've thought about
how to tell you this.

225
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,451
The bottom line, Ross. . .

226
00:14:48,692 --> 00:14:51,286
. . .is, we cannot stay married.

227
00:14:52,652 --> 00:14:55,450
-I don't know if that's true--
-Oh, but it is.

228
00:14:56,132 --> 00:14:58,441
Okay. You know what this is?

229
00:14:58,692 --> 00:15:02,048
This is a difference of opinion.

230
00:15:04,292 --> 00:15:07,045
-When that happens in a marriage--
-Ross, come on!

231
00:15:07,252 --> 00:15:10,722
This is not a marriage!
This is the world's worst hangover!

232
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:15,004
Ross, listen, if you do not
get this annulment, I will.

233
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:19,048
All right.

234
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,605
All right, I'll do it.

235
00:15:20,812 --> 00:15:22,131
Thank you.

236
00:15:23,452 --> 00:15:24,646
Hey, hey. . .

237
00:15:25,652 --> 00:15:28,803
. . .is there any such thing
as an annulment shower?

238
00:15:32,852 --> 00:15:35,161
There's the train station,
where I get off.

239
00:15:35,372 --> 00:15:37,602
I have your address
and phone number.

240
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:40,724
I have your name and the fact
that you're a drifter.

241
00:15:40,932 --> 00:15:43,651
So ball's pretty much
in your court.

242
00:15:44,612 --> 00:15:46,170
All right. See you, Pheebs.

243
00:15:54,452 --> 00:15:56,920
Come on, Pheebs, I can't
take this anymore.

244
00:15:57,132 --> 00:15:58,360
Please talk to me.

245
00:16:00,332 --> 00:16:02,527
Let me make it up to you.

246
00:16:04,092 --> 00:16:07,801
Ground control to Major Tom

247
00:16:09,212 --> 00:16:12,841
Commencing countdown
Engines on

248
00:16:15,092 --> 00:16:17,162
Take your protein pills

249
00:16:17,412 --> 00:16:21,121
And put your helmet on

250
00:16:22,052 --> 00:16:24,850
-This is--
-Stop it! Stop it! No!

251
00:16:26,332 --> 00:16:30,007
That's not fair. You know I can't
resist that beautiful voice.

252
00:16:30,812 --> 00:16:33,201
Pheebs, look, I am so sorry.

253
00:16:33,412 --> 00:16:36,051
I promised you a fun
road trip with your friend. . .

254
00:16:36,292 --> 00:16:38,852
. . .and I didn't deliver, okay?

255
00:16:39,052 --> 00:16:43,807
Now I know that you think being awake
is an important part of friendship.

256
00:16:44,932 --> 00:16:48,641
So I will strive to stay awake
for as long as I know you.

257
00:16:51,252 --> 00:16:53,641
You can still sleep
at night and stuff.

258
00:16:54,852 --> 00:16:56,046
Thank you.

259
00:16:56,732 --> 00:16:58,962
So can we play 20 Questions now?

260
00:16:59,172 --> 00:17:01,891
I got a good one.
I thought about it since Kansas.

261
00:17:03,092 --> 00:17:03,888
Okay.

262
00:17:05,412 --> 00:17:06,970
Is it. . .

263
00:17:07,172 --> 00:17:09,447
. . .a kind of hot sandwich?

264
00:17:10,092 --> 00:17:11,411
Yes.

265
00:17:12,412 --> 00:17:13,970
Is it a meatball sub?

266
00:17:14,212 --> 00:17:16,043
That is incredible!

267
00:17:16,532 --> 00:17:18,329
You are the master!

268
00:17:20,932 --> 00:17:22,251
Bug!

269
00:17:25,852 --> 00:17:28,047
-You look like you're--
-Don't say it!

270
00:17:28,252 --> 00:17:29,844
Don't even think it.

271
00:17:30,692 --> 00:17:32,250
All right.

272
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:34,010
Chandler, enjoy your handful.

273
00:17:38,252 --> 00:17:39,844
Should we just get married?

274
00:17:40,052 --> 00:17:42,646
All the signs are telling us to do it.

275
00:17:42,852 --> 00:17:44,126
I'm sick of the signs.

276
00:17:44,332 --> 00:17:46,926
-I'm happy the way things are.
-Me too.

277
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:48,804
-I don't want change, do you?
-No.

278
00:17:49,012 --> 00:17:52,049
Then nothing changes!
Everything stays the same!

279
00:17:52,252 --> 00:17:55,130
Go unpack. It's been three days,
and it drives me insane!

280
00:17:57,252 --> 00:17:59,641
Jeez, relax, it's not
like we're mar--

281
00:18:09,412 --> 00:18:11,528
You know, I was thinking
what if l. . .

282
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:13,485
. . .unpack here?

283
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:15,325
All your stuff would be here.

284
00:18:17,452 --> 00:18:18,646
Well. . . .

285
00:18:21,332 --> 00:18:23,084
What if all my stuff was here?

286
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:26,451
Then you'd be going back
and forth all the time.

287
00:18:27,092 --> 00:18:28,684
Doesn't make any sense.

288
00:18:29,052 --> 00:18:30,451
Okay.

289
00:18:32,892 --> 00:18:35,929
What if we live together,
and you get what I'm saying?

290
00:18:39,132 --> 00:18:40,645
Live together?

291
00:18:41,612 --> 00:18:43,045
There've been no signs for that.

292
00:18:43,732 --> 00:18:46,246
Me asking is kind of a sign.

293
00:18:50,492 --> 00:18:52,448
Yes! Yes! Yes!

294
00:18:57,852 --> 00:19:00,082
Okay. Okay, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

295
00:19:00,292 --> 00:19:02,089
Here's your key. Here's your key.

296
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:03,850
Now go out and christen it!

297
00:19:04,052 --> 00:19:05,405
Go out and come back in!

298
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:08,046
Door hasn't been locked
in five years, but okay.

299
00:19:09,492 --> 00:19:11,448
-Ready?
-Ready!

300
00:19:12,532 --> 00:19:15,046
The key broke in the lock,
and I can't get in.

301
00:19:15,252 --> 00:19:17,846
Wait. Oh, my God, I can't get out!

302
00:19:18,052 --> 00:19:20,612
-This isn't a sign!
-No, it's a very old key!

303
00:19:20,812 --> 00:19:23,042
-It's an old key!
-Oh, my God, it's old!

304
00:19:23,892 --> 00:19:25,041
I love you.

305
00:19:26,852 --> 00:19:28,444
I love you.

306
00:19:29,092 --> 00:19:32,050
Are you hugging the door right now?

307
00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:38,441
No.

308
00:19:39,732 --> 00:19:41,450
Yeah, yeah, me neither.

309
00:19:45,372 --> 00:19:48,364
So did everything go all right
with the annulment?

310
00:19:48,572 --> 00:19:51,370
Oh, yeah. No problems.
It's all taken care of.

311
00:19:51,572 --> 00:19:52,800
Ross, thank you.

312
00:19:54,492 --> 00:19:55,925
Do you wanna go see a movie?

313
00:19:56,132 --> 00:19:57,850
-Yeah, why not?
-Pheebs?

314
00:19:58,052 --> 00:19:59,849
Thanks, I've already seen one.

315
00:20:01,252 --> 00:20:03,049
Okay, I'm gonna get my sweater.

316
00:20:07,452 --> 00:20:09,124
You wanna hear something weird?

317
00:20:09,332 --> 00:20:10,651
Always.

318
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,248
I didn't get the annulment.

319
00:20:16,012 --> 00:20:16,922
What?

320
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,645
We're still married.

321
00:20:19,812 --> 00:20:21,803
Don't tell Rachel. See you later.

322
00:20:34,332 --> 00:20:35,321
What are you doing?

323
00:20:35,532 --> 00:20:36,965
Key is stuck in the lock.

324
00:20:37,172 --> 00:20:38,651
I can fix it. Hold on.

325
00:20:40,652 --> 00:20:42,051
Watch out, watch out.

326
00:20:48,092 --> 00:20:49,241
It still doesn't work.

327
00:20:49,452 --> 00:20:50,851
I'm not finished.

328
00:21:01,412 --> 00:21:04,370
Nice job, Joe.
You're quite the craftsman!
