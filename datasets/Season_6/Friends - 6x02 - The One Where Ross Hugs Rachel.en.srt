1
00:00:04,572 --> 00:00:06,767
Did everything go okay
with the annulment?

2
00:00:07,012 --> 00:00:09,162
No problems.
It's all taken care of.

3
00:00:09,372 --> 00:00:10,600
Ross, thank you.

4
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:13,691
Want to go see a movie?

5
00:00:13,892 --> 00:00:14,847
Yeah, why not?

6
00:00:15,052 --> 00:00:16,451
I'll get my sweater.

7
00:00:19,772 --> 00:00:21,251
Want to hear something weird?

8
00:00:21,452 --> 00:00:22,726
Always.

9
00:00:24,332 --> 00:00:26,323
I didn't get the annulment.

10
00:00:27,532 --> 00:00:28,521
What?

11
00:00:28,772 --> 00:00:30,125
We're still married.

12
00:00:31,412 --> 00:00:33,403
Don't tell Rachel. See you later.

13
00:00:37,012 --> 00:00:38,525
Do you have any gum?

14
00:00:40,492 --> 00:00:44,246
Wait! Wait! Ross, can I just
talk to you for just a second?

15
00:00:44,452 --> 00:00:46,124
We'll be late for the movie.

16
00:00:46,372 --> 00:00:48,090
There's a cab. Taxi!

17
00:00:48,812 --> 00:00:50,291
That's great.

18
00:00:50,492 --> 00:00:53,052
What timing! My God, huh?
There you go.

19
00:00:53,772 --> 00:00:56,332
We're gonna walk.
It's right at the Angelika.

20
00:00:56,572 --> 00:00:57,891
The Angelika! Go! Go!

21
00:01:00,092 --> 00:01:01,764
You didn't get the annulment?!

22
00:01:01,972 --> 00:01:03,564
I know.

23
00:01:05,052 --> 00:01:08,328
I tried, but when I got to
my lawyer's office, all I heard was:

24
00:01:08,532 --> 00:01:10,966
"Three divorces! Three divorces! "

25
00:01:12,332 --> 00:01:16,689
I just don't want my tombstone to read
"Ross Geller: Three Divorces. "

26
00:01:16,892 --> 00:01:20,328
Don't worry about that. Your tombstone
can say whatever you want.

27
00:01:20,572 --> 00:01:23,166
It can say,
"Ross Geller: Good at Marriage. "

28
00:01:24,212 --> 00:01:28,330
You know what? Mine's gonna say,
"Phoebe Buffay: Buried Alive. "

29
00:01:28,892 --> 00:01:32,248
All I know is, I can't have
another failed marriage.

30
00:01:32,452 --> 00:01:36,161
So you're gonna be married to
a girl who doesn't even know about it?

31
00:01:36,412 --> 00:01:38,130
Woman. Sorry.

32
00:01:40,132 --> 00:01:42,965
Okay, so I don't have it all
worked out quite yet.

33
00:01:43,212 --> 00:01:45,442
Just don't say anything to Rachel.

34
00:01:45,692 --> 00:01:48,525
Rachel is one of my closest friends.

35
00:01:48,812 --> 00:01:52,805
But being the only one that knows
about this makes me feel special. Okay.

36
00:01:55,652 --> 00:01:58,007
Okay, stop, stop! Phoebe?

37
00:01:58,212 --> 00:01:59,531
Hey, Rach!

38
00:02:00,692 --> 00:02:02,171
What was that?

39
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,930
Sorry. Mix-up.

40
00:02:05,012 --> 00:02:06,206
How was the movie?

41
00:02:06,972 --> 00:02:08,724
I haven't seen it yet.

42
00:02:08,972 --> 00:02:11,008
You'd better hurry.
The Angelika! Go!

43
00:02:14,452 --> 00:02:16,408
The One Where Ross Hugs Rachel

44
00:02:16,652 --> 00:02:17,641
English Subtitles by
Gelula/SDI

45
00:02:51,932 --> 00:02:54,241
When I move in,
can I get a gumball machine?

46
00:02:54,492 --> 00:02:57,325
Of course. Joey wouldn't
let you have one?

47
00:02:57,572 --> 00:03:00,723
No, when it comes to sweets,
he's surprisingly strict.

48
00:03:01,692 --> 00:03:03,728
Did you tell him you're moving out?

49
00:03:03,972 --> 00:03:07,123
No, I keep trying.
And I can get out "Joey, I have to--"

50
00:03:07,372 --> 00:03:11,126
Then I lose my nerve and I finish
with "--go to the bathroom. "

51
00:03:11,732 --> 00:03:13,131
He may think I'm sick.

52
00:03:14,012 --> 00:03:17,368
I have to tell Rachel, but. . . .
We just gotta get it over with.

53
00:03:17,612 --> 00:03:20,684
Next time we see them,
we'll just tell them. That's it.

54
00:03:20,892 --> 00:03:23,929
That's how it'll work now?
You'll just order me around?

55
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:26,524
-Pretty much.
-All right.

56
00:03:28,812 --> 00:03:30,530
Hey, man, you feeling better?

57
00:03:35,292 --> 00:03:36,930
We have something to tell you.

58
00:03:37,932 --> 00:03:39,126
Oh, my God!

59
00:03:39,372 --> 00:03:41,010
You're pregnant!

60
00:03:42,612 --> 00:03:44,125
No!

61
00:03:47,732 --> 00:03:49,529
Look, Joe, here's the thing.

62
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:55,121
Monica and I have decided
to live together, here.

63
00:03:55,972 --> 00:03:57,883
I'm gonna be moving out, man.

64
00:04:04,932 --> 00:04:08,925
I'm really happy for you guys.
Congratulations. See you later.

65
00:04:09,972 --> 00:04:10,961
Are you okay?

66
00:04:11,172 --> 00:04:13,527
I gotta go. I've got an acting job.

67
00:04:15,612 --> 00:04:16,806
Like you'd believe that.

68
00:04:18,612 --> 00:04:19,727
This sucks!

69
00:04:20,212 --> 00:04:22,726
I'll be across the hall.
And I promise you. . .

70
00:04:22,932 --> 00:04:26,322
. . .the minute Monica and I break up,
I'm moving right back in.

71
00:04:27,812 --> 00:04:29,723
If you're gonna move in with him. . .

72
00:04:29,932 --> 00:04:33,163
. . .I feel it is my responsibility
to tell you the truth about him.

73
00:04:33,412 --> 00:04:35,448
He's a terrible roommate. Terrible.

74
00:04:35,652 --> 00:04:37,290
He forgets to. . . .

75
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:40,448
He always, he always. . . .

76
00:04:41,492 --> 00:04:43,403
Who am I kidding?
He's the best roommate!

77
00:04:48,812 --> 00:04:51,167
Hey, Pheebs.
Have you seen Rachel?

78
00:04:51,372 --> 00:04:53,488
-No, why?
-I have some exciting news.

79
00:04:54,012 --> 00:04:55,127
You're pregnant.

80
00:04:56,412 --> 00:04:57,891
No!

81
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:00,684
Chandler and I are moving in together.

82
00:05:00,892 --> 00:05:02,371
Oh, that's good!

83
00:05:02,612 --> 00:05:06,127
But if you were pregnant,
what would you name it? Hint, Phoebe.

84
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,120
What's up?

85
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:15,321
Chandler and I are moving in together.

86
00:05:15,572 --> 00:05:17,608
Oh, my God.

87
00:05:17,932 --> 00:05:21,322
Oh, my little sister
and my best friend. . .

88
00:05:21,532 --> 00:05:23,090
. . .shacking up.

89
00:05:24,732 --> 00:05:26,927
That's great. That's great.

90
00:05:27,572 --> 00:05:28,925
Guys, I'm happy too.

91
00:05:29,172 --> 00:05:30,525
Okay, come here.

92
00:05:31,572 --> 00:05:35,929
Big day, huh? People moving in.
People getting annulled.

93
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:40,769
I gotta go find Rachel.

94
00:05:41,012 --> 00:05:45,130
If you see her, give her some really
bad news, so mine doesn't seem so bad.

95
00:05:48,412 --> 00:05:50,687
Something bad to tell Rachel.

96
00:05:52,372 --> 00:05:54,727
Bad news for Rachel.
What could that be?

97
00:05:55,932 --> 00:05:58,127
Can you just lay off, please?

98
00:05:58,372 --> 00:06:02,729
My life is an embarrassment. I should
just go live under somebody's stairs.

99
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:06,848
It's not that big a deal.
You'll have been divorced three times.

100
00:06:07,092 --> 00:06:09,048
You'll have a life, you'll date--

101
00:06:09,252 --> 00:06:13,245
No, I won't. I'll be at the bottom
of the dating barrel now.

102
00:06:13,492 --> 00:06:16,165
The only guys below me
will be Four-Divorce Guy. . .

103
00:06:16,412 --> 00:06:18,323
. . .Murderer Guy. . .

104
00:06:18,532 --> 00:06:20,170
. . .and geologists.

105
00:06:21,492 --> 00:06:25,326
Ross, you're being ridiculous.
You are cute and smart and sweet.

106
00:06:25,572 --> 00:06:28,609
That is much more important
than three stupid divorces.

107
00:06:28,812 --> 00:06:31,690
Have you dated anyone
who's been divorced three times?

108
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:36,044
That's not fair. Most guys that have
been divorced three times are 60.

109
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,127
Nobody cares about this except you.

110
00:06:40,332 --> 00:06:43,529
This embarrassment thing is
all in your head.

111
00:06:44,092 --> 00:06:46,731
-Here, I'll show you. Come here.
-What?

112
00:06:46,972 --> 00:06:50,931
Hi. My friend Ross is about to be
divorced for the third time.

113
00:06:51,132 --> 00:06:52,531
But wouldn't you date him?

114
00:06:53,812 --> 00:06:56,690
And if you wait right here,
I'll go get Ross.

115
00:07:01,372 --> 00:07:02,521
Thought you were Rachel.

116
00:07:02,972 --> 00:07:04,724
What gave me away?

117
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:06,441
I gotta tell her.

118
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:08,842
I told Ross and Phoebe.
She's the only one left.

119
00:07:09,052 --> 00:07:11,566
It's official.
We're moving in together.

120
00:07:11,812 --> 00:07:15,009
No turning back.
Are you scared? Are you?!

121
00:07:16,172 --> 00:07:17,161
No.

122
00:07:17,372 --> 00:07:19,363
That was my scariest voice.
You're brave.

123
00:07:24,092 --> 00:07:25,161
The worst day.

124
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:29,803
You're finally making progress at work,
then your boss calls you Racquel.

125
00:07:30,972 --> 00:07:34,931
Listen, for the first four years
of my work, everybody called me. . . .

126
00:07:41,012 --> 00:07:42,923
-Seriously.
-I believe you.

127
00:07:44,412 --> 00:07:48,121
It was in the middle of a meeting,
so no one wants to correct her.

128
00:07:48,332 --> 00:07:49,970
So everyone's calling me Racquel.

129
00:07:50,212 --> 00:07:53,727
By the end of the day, the mailroom
guys were calling me Rocky.

130
00:07:55,332 --> 00:07:58,722
Well, I still think you're
very, very nice and very pretty.

131
00:07:59,692 --> 00:08:00,681
What?

132
00:08:02,292 --> 00:08:03,771
All yours, babe.

133
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:07,641
Have a seat.

134
00:08:09,612 --> 00:08:11,842
Listen, Chandler and l. . .

135
00:08:12,572 --> 00:08:14,324
. . .are going to live together.

136
00:08:14,692 --> 00:08:15,681
Here.

137
00:08:18,892 --> 00:08:20,007
Oh, my God.

138
00:08:21,452 --> 00:08:22,931
That's so great!

139
00:08:24,572 --> 00:08:26,881
I'm so happy for you guys!

140
00:08:27,092 --> 00:08:28,127
Really?

141
00:08:28,372 --> 00:08:30,602
And that was so sweet of you to ask.

142
00:08:30,812 --> 00:08:34,521
The three of us are gonna have
such a good time living together!

143
00:08:36,292 --> 00:08:37,327
Yes, we are.

144
00:08:38,412 --> 00:08:41,449
Chandler, you'll have to watch
those long showers you take. . .

145
00:08:41,692 --> 00:08:44,490
. . .because you know
Racquel can't be late.

146
00:08:46,172 --> 00:08:47,400
He'll work on that.

147
00:08:48,972 --> 00:08:50,724
This is so exciting!

148
00:08:53,732 --> 00:08:55,962
Come and knock on our door

149
00:08:58,172 --> 00:09:00,208
We'll be waiting for you

150
00:09:03,692 --> 00:09:06,570
See? Once you know the stories,
it's not that bad.

151
00:09:06,772 --> 00:09:10,162
First marriage: Wife's hidden
sexuality. Not my fault.

152
00:09:11,252 --> 00:09:14,130
Second marriage:
Said the wrong name at the altar.

153
00:09:14,372 --> 00:09:16,010
A little my fault.

154
00:09:17,212 --> 00:09:20,170
Third marriage: They shouldn't
let you get married. . .

155
00:09:20,412 --> 00:09:22,721
. . .when you're drunk
and have writing on your face.

156
00:09:22,932 --> 00:09:24,411
Nevada's fault.

157
00:09:25,892 --> 00:09:29,680
So what do you think, ladies?
Who wouldn't want to date him?

158
00:09:30,012 --> 00:09:32,242
The divorces don't bother me.
I'd date him.

159
00:09:32,492 --> 00:09:33,925
But not while he's still married.

160
00:09:34,172 --> 00:09:36,083
And you, wouldn't you want to date?

161
00:09:36,292 --> 00:09:38,169
I'm not dating at all anymore.

162
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:40,926
I was only dating guys
that were bad for me.

163
00:09:41,172 --> 00:09:42,571
So I decided that--

164
00:09:42,772 --> 00:09:44,091
Good. Good. Whatever.

165
00:09:45,372 --> 00:09:46,361
And you, Meg?

166
00:09:46,612 --> 00:09:49,285
Well, I don't care about
the divorces, either.

167
00:09:49,492 --> 00:09:51,528
But I wouldn't date him.

168
00:09:52,612 --> 00:09:56,127
It's just that he's obviously
still in love with this Rachel girl.

169
00:09:56,372 --> 00:09:57,168
What?

170
00:09:57,612 --> 00:10:01,048
She said, "He's obviously still
in love with this Rachel girl. "

171
00:10:03,772 --> 00:10:06,969
This is crazy. I mean, yes,
Rachel is my good friend.

172
00:10:07,212 --> 00:10:09,726
And I have loved her in the past. . .

173
00:10:09,972 --> 00:10:12,167
. . .but now, she is just my wife.

174
00:10:14,372 --> 00:10:16,408
Phoebe, will you help me out here?

175
00:10:16,612 --> 00:10:19,524
Well, I thought you loved her
when you married her.

176
00:10:19,772 --> 00:10:24,004
We were drunk! I would've married
Joey with that amount of alcohol.

177
00:10:24,972 --> 00:10:27,532
You could do a lot worse
than Joey Tribbiani!

178
00:10:29,972 --> 00:10:31,724
I'm sorry, but you guys are wrong.

179
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:35,049
I just don't want
to be divorced three times.

180
00:10:35,252 --> 00:10:37,447
Now he's using
this three-divorces reason. . .

181
00:10:37,692 --> 00:10:40,809
. . .because he wants to stay married
to her because he loves her.

182
00:10:41,052 --> 00:10:43,361
I must say, well done. Bravo, Meg.

183
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:47,890
Fine. If this is what you think,
forget about. . .

184
00:10:48,092 --> 00:10:49,525
. . .the whole three-divorce thing.

185
00:10:49,772 --> 00:10:53,924
I'll go to my lawyer's office right now
and get this marriage annulled.

186
00:10:54,132 --> 00:10:55,724
She means nothing to me.

187
00:10:55,972 --> 00:10:57,769
Nothing!

188
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:03,121
Okay, now I wouldn't date you
because you seem a little creepy.

189
00:11:03,572 --> 00:11:05,642
I am so attracted to him right now.

190
00:11:10,812 --> 00:11:13,531
When will we tell Rachel
what actually will happen?

191
00:11:13,732 --> 00:11:14,642
Soon.

192
00:11:14,852 --> 00:11:17,525
I just couldn't before.
You saw how upset Joey got.

193
00:11:17,772 --> 00:11:20,002
I couldn't do it.
She's my best friend.

194
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:21,645
Joey's my best friend.

195
00:11:22,372 --> 00:11:24,328
I'm not your best friend?

196
00:11:25,692 --> 00:11:26,966
You just said--!

197
00:11:28,572 --> 00:11:30,528
Of course, you're my best friend.

198
00:11:31,452 --> 00:11:32,680
Would you tell Rachel?

199
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,931
All right. At least I'm prepared.

200
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:38,925
Oh, yes.

201
00:11:40,852 --> 00:11:43,446
-They're not for you. Are you upset?
-I am now.

202
00:11:46,212 --> 00:11:47,611
Hey, roomie.

203
00:11:48,012 --> 00:11:49,604
Okay, bye.

204
00:11:54,412 --> 00:11:57,882
There's something important
I have to tell you.

205
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,320
Are you pregnant?

206
00:12:00,492 --> 00:12:02,289
No, but I'm throwing this shirt away.

207
00:12:04,052 --> 00:12:07,124
I think there was a little
misunderstanding before.

208
00:12:07,692 --> 00:12:12,482
When I said that Chandler and I
wanted to live together. . .

209
00:12:12,972 --> 00:12:15,805
. . .we meant alone together.

210
00:12:19,692 --> 00:12:22,729
Oh, my God. That's funny.
I can't believe I did that.

211
00:12:22,972 --> 00:12:25,532
No, sweetie. You know what?
This is my fault.

212
00:12:25,772 --> 00:12:27,330
I wasn't clear.

213
00:12:27,532 --> 00:12:29,488
I'm really sorry.

214
00:12:30,172 --> 00:12:33,448
Listen, you take as much time
as you need to move out, okay?

215
00:12:33,692 --> 00:12:35,330
There's absolutely no rush.

216
00:12:36,572 --> 00:12:37,721
Okay.

217
00:12:44,412 --> 00:12:45,925
Don't you want a cookie?

218
00:12:46,812 --> 00:12:47,927
Sure.

219
00:12:50,332 --> 00:12:51,367
Thanks.

220
00:12:51,612 --> 00:12:52,931
Do you need a tissue?

221
00:12:56,812 --> 00:12:59,246
-Where did you get these?
-I made them.

222
00:12:59,452 --> 00:13:02,046
Oh, God, they're so yummy!

223
00:13:05,412 --> 00:13:08,768
It's gonna be weird when I come home
and you're not here.

224
00:13:09,052 --> 00:13:10,724
No more Joey and Chan's.

225
00:13:10,972 --> 00:13:13,042
No more J and C's.

226
00:13:13,412 --> 00:13:16,529
Want to go to Joey and Chandler's?
Can't. It's not there.

227
00:13:17,492 --> 00:13:20,723
I'll be across the hall.
We can still do all the same stuff.

228
00:13:20,972 --> 00:13:23,691
We won't be able to have
those long talks at night. . .

229
00:13:23,892 --> 00:13:25,769
. . .about our feelings and the future.

230
00:13:26,812 --> 00:13:28,291
Not once did we do that.

231
00:13:32,572 --> 00:13:35,564
I told Rachel that it's just
gonna be the two of us.

232
00:13:35,812 --> 00:13:38,007
Oh, yeah? Well, how'd she take it?

233
00:13:38,532 --> 00:13:39,726
Really well.

234
00:13:40,492 --> 00:13:41,971
Surprisingly well.

235
00:13:42,212 --> 00:13:45,284
She didn't cry.
She wasn't angry or sad.

236
00:13:48,092 --> 00:13:51,402
And you're upset because you
didn't make your best friend cry?

237
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:54,362
All I'm asking for is
a little emotion.

238
00:13:54,612 --> 00:13:56,648
Is that too much to ask
after six years?

239
00:13:56,892 --> 00:13:59,531
What, are Rachel and I
not as close as you guys?

240
00:13:59,732 --> 00:14:03,691
I mean, did we not have as much fun?
Don't I deserve a few tears?

241
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,963
When we told Joey,
he cried his eyes out.

242
00:14:08,292 --> 00:14:10,806
I did not cry my eyes out!

243
00:14:11,332 --> 00:14:13,368
Come on, it's like the end of an era.

244
00:14:13,612 --> 00:14:15,409
No more J-Man and Channy's!

245
00:14:17,332 --> 00:14:19,562
Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?

246
00:14:25,892 --> 00:14:28,008
You got married again?

247
00:14:29,052 --> 00:14:30,041
Yes.

248
00:14:30,932 --> 00:14:34,288
So that's your second marriage
in two years?

249
00:14:34,492 --> 00:14:36,722
Yes. Second in two years.

250
00:14:36,972 --> 00:14:39,202
Third, overall.

251
00:14:39,932 --> 00:14:42,571
I have been a divorce attorney
for 23 years. . .

252
00:14:42,812 --> 00:14:45,770
. . .and never have I had
so much business from one client.

253
00:14:47,612 --> 00:14:50,331
Why don't you tell me what happened?

254
00:14:51,212 --> 00:14:54,841
Basically, Rachel and I were
in Vegas, and we got drunk.

255
00:14:55,052 --> 00:14:58,249
I'm sorry, is this the same Rachel
whose name you said. . .

256
00:14:58,492 --> 00:15:00,289
. . .at the altar
in the second marriage?

257
00:15:00,492 --> 00:15:02,130
Yes, yes, yes.

258
00:15:02,492 --> 00:15:04,323
But I do not love her.

259
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:07,330
That's better then.

260
00:15:08,732 --> 00:15:12,042
This was just a drunken mistake,
and I need to get it annulled.

261
00:15:12,252 --> 00:15:13,321
I see.

262
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:16,280
Have you considered therapy?

263
00:15:18,132 --> 00:15:21,761
I think just the annulment for today.

264
00:15:22,052 --> 00:15:24,247
-There are some forms to fill out.
-Easy.

265
00:15:24,492 --> 00:15:28,724
We'll need witnesses who can testify
that you were not of sound mind.

266
00:15:28,932 --> 00:15:30,729
No problem.

267
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:34,009
We'll need you and Rachel
to testify before a judge.

268
00:15:37,492 --> 00:15:39,722
There's no way to do this without her?

269
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:43,681
Because I kind of already told her
it was taken care of.

270
00:15:43,892 --> 00:15:45,803
Of course you did.

271
00:15:47,612 --> 00:15:51,810
Look, you can't get an annulment
unless you and Rachel are both there.

272
00:15:53,532 --> 00:15:56,569
What about someone
who looks like Rachel?

273
00:15:58,092 --> 00:15:59,969
I will think about the therapy.

274
00:16:07,332 --> 00:16:11,530
So I was thinking that maybe we
should start dividing up our stuff.

275
00:16:12,212 --> 00:16:13,531
Okay.

276
00:16:14,092 --> 00:16:15,889
No point in dragging it out.

277
00:16:16,412 --> 00:16:19,404
Dragging out the long process
of you moving out. . .

278
00:16:19,652 --> 00:16:21,688
. . .and us not living together anymore.

279
00:16:28,452 --> 00:16:30,920
What about this? Who gets this?

280
00:16:31,132 --> 00:16:34,727
I don't know if I want it because
it might be too many memories.

281
00:16:36,332 --> 00:16:37,811
-What is that?
-I don't know.

282
00:16:41,172 --> 00:16:43,925
How about this?
I want you to have the big plate.

283
00:16:44,932 --> 00:16:48,049
Wow, Monica, thanks.
I love this plate.

284
00:16:48,372 --> 00:16:51,045
Something to remember me by.

285
00:16:52,292 --> 00:16:54,806
Mon, you're not dying.
I'm just moving out.

286
00:16:55,732 --> 00:16:58,121
We're gonna see each other
all the time.

287
00:16:58,412 --> 00:17:01,165
But still, it's a big change.

288
00:17:01,412 --> 00:17:04,404
The end of an era, you might say.

289
00:17:07,212 --> 00:17:09,009
Are you okay? You're not blinking.

290
00:17:10,172 --> 00:17:14,165
I'm fine. I was thinking about
how it's an end of an era.

291
00:17:14,612 --> 00:17:16,125
Oh, all right.

292
00:17:17,932 --> 00:17:21,925
But I gotta say, I don't think
six years counts as an era.

293
00:17:22,172 --> 00:17:24,925
An era is defined as
a significant period of time.

294
00:17:25,172 --> 00:17:28,403
It was significant for me.
Maybe it wasn't significant to you!

295
00:17:28,612 --> 00:17:31,888
-What is the matter with you?
-What is the matter with you?!

296
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:34,765
Why aren't you more upset?

297
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,924
Aren't you gonna be sad
that we're not living together?

298
00:17:38,172 --> 00:17:40,049
Aren't you gonna miss me at all?

299
00:17:40,372 --> 00:17:43,091
Monica, all right.
But don't get mad at me.

300
00:17:44,732 --> 00:17:47,246
It's just a little hard to believe.

301
00:17:47,972 --> 00:17:49,325
What's hard to believe?

302
00:17:49,572 --> 00:17:53,531
I mean, it's you guys.
You do this kind of stuff, you know?

303
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:57,685
You were gonna get married in Vegas,
and then you backed out.

304
00:17:57,932 --> 00:18:02,164
I'm not upset because I don't see you
going through with it. I'm sorry.

305
00:18:08,052 --> 00:18:09,929
It's going to happen.

306
00:18:10,332 --> 00:18:11,685
Chandler will move in here.

307
00:18:11,892 --> 00:18:14,645
-But l--
-I know, just let me finish, okay?

308
00:18:15,532 --> 00:18:19,161
This isn't something that we just
impulsively decided to do in Vegas.

309
00:18:19,412 --> 00:18:21,801
This is something
that we both really want.

310
00:18:23,492 --> 00:18:25,801
And it is going to happen.

311
00:18:26,612 --> 00:18:27,931
It is?

312
00:18:30,012 --> 00:18:31,240
Really?

313
00:18:31,692 --> 00:18:33,284
Yeah, sweetie.

314
00:18:35,012 --> 00:18:38,766
You mean, we're not gonna
live together anymore?

315
00:18:44,212 --> 00:18:46,851
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna miss you so much.

316
00:18:47,052 --> 00:18:48,770
I'm gonna miss you.

317
00:18:49,972 --> 00:18:51,610
I mean, it's the end of an era!

318
00:18:51,812 --> 00:18:53,245
I know!

319
00:18:56,532 --> 00:18:58,887
-Okay, bye.
-Oh, no.

320
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:01,767
So did you get the annulment?

321
00:19:01,972 --> 00:19:02,768
I couldn't.

322
00:19:02,972 --> 00:19:04,963
I knew it. Because you love Rachel.

323
00:19:05,732 --> 00:19:08,530
It's not that.
Annulments are more complicated--

324
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,922
Complicated because of the love.

325
00:19:11,372 --> 00:19:13,840
I do not love Rachel.

326
00:19:14,092 --> 00:19:15,923
I'm telling her
about the whole thing. . .

327
00:19:16,172 --> 00:19:19,244
. . .so we can get this marriage
annulled as fast as possible.

328
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,369
Would I do that if I loved her?

329
00:19:21,572 --> 00:19:24,405
I've never been more convinced
of your love for her.

330
00:19:24,812 --> 00:19:28,725
I do not have feelings
for Rachel, okay?

331
00:19:31,772 --> 00:19:34,047
Oh, what's wrong?

332
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,123
Monica and Chandler are
moving in here. . .

333
00:19:37,372 --> 00:19:40,011
. . .and I have to move out
and everything is changing.

334
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:43,522
Oh, my God, come here, come here.
It's okay.

335
00:19:43,812 --> 00:19:45,962
Everything's gonna be okay.

336
00:19:46,172 --> 00:19:46,968
Thank you.

337
00:19:47,372 --> 00:19:49,124
Of course.

338
00:19:58,612 --> 00:20:01,763
So Ross and Rachel got married.

339
00:20:02,212 --> 00:20:04,646
Monica and Chandler
almost got married.

340
00:20:05,132 --> 00:20:06,645
You think we should hook up?

341
00:20:08,692 --> 00:20:09,841
Oh, we do.

342
00:20:10,092 --> 00:20:11,491
But not just yet.

343
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:14,803
Really? Well, when?

344
00:20:17,692 --> 00:20:20,570
Well, first Chandler and Monica
will get married. . .

345
00:20:20,812 --> 00:20:22,928
. . .and be filthy rich, by the way.

346
00:20:23,132 --> 00:20:24,565
But it won't work out.

347
00:20:25,252 --> 00:20:26,321
I know.

348
00:20:27,772 --> 00:20:30,127
Then I'll marry Chandler
for the money.

349
00:20:30,332 --> 00:20:33,642
And you'll marry Rachel
and have the beautiful kids.

350
00:20:33,852 --> 00:20:35,126
Great.

351
00:20:35,852 --> 00:20:38,161
But then we ditch them
and we get married.

352
00:20:38,812 --> 00:20:41,246
We'll have Chandler's money
and Rachel's kids.

353
00:20:41,492 --> 00:20:45,326
Getting custody will be easy
because of Rachel's drinking problem.

354
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:47,601
What about Ross?

355
00:20:47,812 --> 00:20:49,848
I don't want to go
into the whole thing.

356
00:20:50,092 --> 00:20:52,322
But we have words and I kill him.
