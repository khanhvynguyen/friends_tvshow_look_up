1
00:00:05,092 --> 00:00:07,048
Check it out, this is unbelievable!

2
00:00:07,252 --> 00:00:10,289
Joey's been holding his breath
for almost four minutes.

3
00:00:15,732 --> 00:00:17,324
You trying to kill me?

4
00:00:18,972 --> 00:00:20,610
I want to ask you something.

5
00:00:21,292 --> 00:00:24,682
Since I'm moving out,
and you're so beautiful. . .

6
00:00:25,572 --> 00:00:26,891
. . .how about I move in with you?

7
00:00:27,132 --> 00:00:30,169
That would be great,
but what do we do about Denise?

8
00:00:31,492 --> 00:00:33,210
-Who's Denise?
-My roommate.

9
00:00:33,412 --> 00:00:34,367
Your roommate?

10
00:00:34,572 --> 00:00:36,563
Yes, Denise. Denise!

11
00:00:38,212 --> 00:00:40,442
What is with the secrecy, Phoebe?

12
00:00:40,732 --> 00:00:42,643
What about Denise? She cute?

13
00:00:44,452 --> 00:00:46,443
How can you have a roommate
that we don't know about?

14
00:00:46,692 --> 00:00:48,922
Because you never listen
to what I say.

15
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:51,043
I talk about her all the time.
Denise!

16
00:00:53,292 --> 00:00:56,284
I'm gonna have an extra room
over at my place.

17
00:00:56,492 --> 00:00:57,288
That's true.

18
00:00:57,492 --> 00:01:01,929
Move in with me. We can stay up
late talking, and watch movies.

19
00:01:02,132 --> 00:01:04,123
You know about
naked Thursdays, right?

20
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:09,010
Yeah, yeah. I think
I'll find my own place.

21
00:01:09,332 --> 00:01:12,927
Hey! I thought naked Thursdays
was just our thing, man.

22
00:01:15,292 --> 00:01:17,089
The One With Ross' Denial

24
00:01:54,412 --> 00:01:57,085
What did Rachel say when you told her
you were still married to her?

25
00:01:57,332 --> 00:01:58,401
Oh, that.

26
00:01:59,092 --> 00:02:00,650
She took it really well.

27
00:02:01,292 --> 00:02:03,487
-You didn't tell her, did you?
-No.

28
00:02:04,012 --> 00:02:05,843
Because you're in love with her.

29
00:02:06,052 --> 00:02:10,091
I am not in love with her. She was
upset about having to move out.

30
00:02:10,292 --> 00:02:13,090
If she knew we were still married,
she'd have been more upset.

31
00:02:13,332 --> 00:02:15,482
So I comforted her.
As a friend.

32
00:02:15,772 --> 00:02:17,125
You "comforted her"?

33
00:02:17,372 --> 00:02:19,010
Nothing.
I just gave her a hug.

34
00:02:19,652 --> 00:02:21,847
A classic sign of love,
the hug.

35
00:02:22,572 --> 00:02:24,449
It's also a sign of friendship.

36
00:02:24,692 --> 00:02:26,569
Not in your case, "Lovey Loverson. "

37
00:02:27,852 --> 00:02:29,171
It was a hug.

38
00:02:29,412 --> 00:02:32,210
Did you, or did you not,
smell her hair?

39
00:02:32,812 --> 00:02:34,370
Smell her hair?

40
00:02:35,212 --> 00:02:36,406
What if I did?

41
00:02:36,652 --> 00:02:40,440
Ninety percent of a woman's
pheromones come out of her head.

42
00:02:40,652 --> 00:02:42,290
That's why women are shorter.

43
00:02:43,172 --> 00:02:46,050
So that men will fall in love
when they hug them.

44
00:02:46,692 --> 00:02:49,047
Come on, Ross,
you're a scientist.

45
00:02:50,492 --> 00:02:52,483
I was hugging her as a friend.

46
00:02:52,812 --> 00:02:54,962
It's not my fault
her hair got in my face.

47
00:02:55,212 --> 00:02:57,965
She's got a lot of it,
and it smells all. . .all. . .

48
00:02:59,052 --> 00:03:00,405
. . .coconutty.

49
00:03:02,292 --> 00:03:05,364
What? It doesn't mean
I have feelings for Rachel.

50
00:03:05,572 --> 00:03:08,086
Maybe it means
I have feelings for coconuts.

51
00:03:09,212 --> 00:03:13,205
Okay, but be careful. Rachel's not
in the same place you are.

52
00:03:13,532 --> 00:03:16,205
If the place you're
referring to is being in love. . .

53
00:03:16,492 --> 00:03:20,883
. . .she is in the same place as me,
because I am not in that place.

54
00:03:22,172 --> 00:03:23,685
I didn't understand that.

55
00:03:25,132 --> 00:03:28,602
Maybe that's because you were
speaking the secret language of love.

56
00:03:34,092 --> 00:03:36,367
-A guy just called for you.
-Who was it?

57
00:03:36,612 --> 00:03:39,649
I don't know. How about
"Thanks for taking the message"?

58
00:03:43,132 --> 00:03:44,087
When you move in. . .

59
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:47,682
. . .Rachel's room will be empty.
Let's talk about what to do with it.

60
00:03:48,092 --> 00:03:50,686
I think we should have
a beautiful guest room. . .

61
00:03:50,932 --> 00:03:54,971
. . .with a mahogany sleigh bed and
bedside tables with fresh flowers.

62
00:03:55,292 --> 00:03:59,365
And comment cards so people could
tell us how great their stay was.

63
00:04:01,572 --> 00:04:03,528
I really haven't
thought about it that much.

64
00:04:04,572 --> 00:04:07,086
Well, I like that idea. . .obviously.

65
00:04:07,932 --> 00:04:10,924
I was thinking maybe. . .
maybe it could be a game room.

66
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:15,410
You can buy old arcade games, like
Space lnvaders and Asteroids. . .

67
00:04:15,612 --> 00:04:18,445
. . .for $200. The real ones.
The big, big, big ones!

68
00:04:20,412 --> 00:04:21,367
No.

69
00:04:23,572 --> 00:04:25,449
You mean "No" as in:

70
00:04:25,852 --> 00:04:29,606
"What an interesting idea. Let's
discuss it before we reject it. "

71
00:04:30,372 --> 00:04:31,885
I'm sorry.

72
00:04:33,532 --> 00:04:36,285
Interesting idea. But no.

73
00:04:37,492 --> 00:04:38,971
So that's it?

74
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:42,761
I just don't think arcade games
go in a beautiful guest room. . .

75
00:04:43,012 --> 00:04:45,048
. . .filled with antiques.

76
00:04:45,332 --> 00:04:48,642
Which is why Asteroids is
perfect. It's the oldest game.

77
00:04:50,292 --> 00:04:52,328
What's wrong with
a beautiful guest room?

78
00:04:52,532 --> 00:04:54,443
I'm not against it.

79
00:04:54,652 --> 00:04:58,281
Especially since everybody we know
lives about 30 seconds away.

80
00:04:59,452 --> 00:05:00,680
Are you mocking me?

81
00:05:00,892 --> 00:05:03,281
No, I'm not mocking you
or your beautiful guest room.

82
00:05:10,332 --> 00:05:12,323
Monica and I
had a stupid fight.

83
00:05:12,572 --> 00:05:15,803
You're still moving in together,
right? My ad came out today.

84
00:05:16,812 --> 00:05:20,122
"Wanted: Female roommate,
nonsmoker, nonugly. "

85
00:05:23,052 --> 00:05:24,280
Nice.

86
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:28,889
I figured it'd be more interesting
to have a female roommate.

87
00:05:29,092 --> 00:05:32,607
Someone I could learn from.
Someone who's different than me.

88
00:05:32,812 --> 00:05:36,248
And what's more different than me, a
guy who's not 1 9. . .

89
00:05:36,452 --> 00:05:38,841
. . .than a girl who is 1 9?

90
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:42,730
Not just a hatrack, my friend.

91
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:46,530
Pheebs, I have to ask you--

92
00:05:46,772 --> 00:05:48,251
I'm swamped right now.

93
00:05:49,532 --> 00:05:51,682
You're just staring into space.

94
00:05:51,932 --> 00:05:54,526
I'm trying to move that pencil.

95
00:05:55,692 --> 00:05:57,444
-This one?
-It worked!

96
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:02,723
Pheebs, this whole apartment thing
is a nightmare.

97
00:06:02,932 --> 00:06:06,527
Anything I can afford comes with
a roommate who is a freak. Look.

98
00:06:07,532 --> 00:06:12,003
"Wanted: Female roommate,
nonsmoker, nonugly. "

99
00:06:14,732 --> 00:06:17,041
There's nothing. This city is full.

100
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:18,321
Wait! Look at this!

101
00:06:18,532 --> 00:06:22,525
"Two bedroom, two bath. Must be
nonsmoker. Satan worshipers okay. "

102
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,731
Yeah, but it's on the
ground floor.

103
00:06:29,892 --> 00:06:33,202
-Rach, you still looking for a place?
-Yeah, why?

104
00:06:33,772 --> 00:06:37,731
This guy, Warren, from the museum
is going on a dig for two years.

105
00:06:38,372 --> 00:06:42,126
He's got this great place he needs
to sublet. You interested?

106
00:06:42,332 --> 00:06:45,642
Great! I'd love to live at Warren's.
I love Warren!

107
00:06:46,212 --> 00:06:48,203
-Thank you!
-Don't thank me.

108
00:06:48,412 --> 00:06:51,848
Thank the volcano that erupted
thousands of years ago. . .

109
00:06:52,092 --> 00:06:55,641
. . .killing, but perfectly preserving,
an entire civilization.

110
00:06:57,332 --> 00:06:58,651
Here's Warren's number.

111
00:07:00,172 --> 00:07:03,926
This is great. I'm gonna
call him right now! Thank you!

112
00:07:07,372 --> 00:07:08,964
Okay, you go call him.

113
00:07:10,252 --> 00:07:11,321
I saw it.

114
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:14,963
What are you talking about?

115
00:07:15,252 --> 00:07:18,130
I'm talking about what you already
know but won't admit.

116
00:07:18,332 --> 00:07:20,641
You love her again. You re-love her.

117
00:07:21,292 --> 00:07:23,328
I do not re-love her.

118
00:07:23,572 --> 00:07:26,132
I can't believe
you won't just admit it.

119
00:07:27,092 --> 00:07:29,731
Promise me
you won't do anything stupid.

120
00:07:29,932 --> 00:07:33,766
We're just friends now.
Why would I do anything stupid?

121
00:07:34,652 --> 00:07:36,882
The apartment
is already subletted.

122
00:07:37,092 --> 00:07:40,004
It's hopeless.
I'll never find anything.

123
00:07:40,612 --> 00:07:41,647
Live with me.

124
00:07:42,092 --> 00:07:43,047
-What?
-What?!

125
00:07:44,732 --> 00:07:46,051
What?

126
00:07:50,212 --> 00:07:51,531
Are you serious?

127
00:07:54,172 --> 00:07:57,164
I would love to live with you.
That's great. Thank you.

128
00:07:57,452 --> 00:07:59,647
I'm just glad I could help you out.

129
00:08:01,372 --> 00:08:05,729
Wow, I'm so happy for you guys.
This is so, so, not stupid.

130
00:08:08,452 --> 00:08:10,841
Ross, you have no idea
what this means to me.

131
00:08:11,052 --> 00:08:14,965
I was gonna be homeless.
You just saved me. You're my hero.

132
00:08:15,972 --> 00:08:18,884
Hero? I don't know.
Well, all right.

133
00:08:20,492 --> 00:08:24,007
I have to go tell Monica
what a wonderful brother she has.

134
00:08:24,372 --> 00:08:26,169
Oh, please.

135
00:08:32,932 --> 00:08:35,492
You're gonna say things now,
aren't you?

136
00:08:36,092 --> 00:08:37,844
No. No, I won't.

137
00:08:38,372 --> 00:08:40,249
But I should tell you this.

138
00:08:40,652 --> 00:08:43,371
The same thing happened to my
roommate, Denise.

139
00:08:43,652 --> 00:08:45,802
She moved in with a guy
who was secretly married to her.

140
00:08:46,052 --> 00:08:49,647
He said he didn't love her, but he
really did. And it just blew up.

141
00:08:49,852 --> 00:08:52,446
And that's how she ended up
living with me.

142
00:08:55,412 --> 00:08:56,925
Okay, that's a lie.

143
00:09:01,932 --> 00:09:05,322
Listen, I'm sorry about before.
I don't need a game room.

144
00:09:05,652 --> 00:09:09,440
I only played those games because I
couldn't get girls. Now I can get--

145
00:09:11,372 --> 00:09:12,487
Now I have you.

146
00:09:14,092 --> 00:09:16,162
No, not that I think I have you. . .

147
00:09:16,452 --> 00:09:20,525
. . .or think of you as property
in any sort of way. I see women. . . .

148
00:09:20,732 --> 00:09:22,211
Stop it, Chandler.

149
00:09:23,612 --> 00:09:24,727
I'm sorry too.

150
00:09:25,292 --> 00:09:27,931
-Really?
-Yeah. Oh, yes.

151
00:09:29,732 --> 00:09:32,963
We can think of something
to do with the room together.

152
00:09:33,212 --> 00:09:36,841
Great idea. We can easily think of
a way for us both to enjoy the room.

153
00:09:37,172 --> 00:09:38,400
Totally.

154
00:09:43,532 --> 00:09:45,841
-We don't have to decide now.
-Good.

155
00:09:46,612 --> 00:09:49,365
Let's think about changes
we can make in the living room.

156
00:09:49,972 --> 00:09:50,802
Changes?

157
00:09:52,012 --> 00:09:55,368
We'll have to move some
furniture to make room for my chair.

158
00:09:57,732 --> 00:09:59,882
You're bringing the Barcalounger
over here?

159
00:10:00,492 --> 00:10:01,481
Is that a problem?

160
00:10:03,412 --> 00:10:06,370
It's just that they're a set
and should stay together.

161
00:10:06,612 --> 00:10:08,682
That's cool.
I'll bring them both over.

162
00:10:09,332 --> 00:10:12,210
You're taking them away
from their home.

163
00:10:13,252 --> 00:10:16,801
I get it. I get nothing. Nothing
here is mine. Everything is yours.

164
00:10:17,052 --> 00:10:20,328
I'll get up in the morning, put on
your clothes and go off to work!

165
00:10:20,772 --> 00:10:25,050
Yeah, that's it. Everything
will be mine. Nothing will be yours.

166
00:10:25,612 --> 00:10:27,284
I'm talking about the Barcalounger.

167
00:10:27,532 --> 00:10:29,648
It doesn't match.
Where will it go?

168
00:10:29,892 --> 00:10:31,450
In the game room!

169
00:10:31,652 --> 00:10:34,803
It is not my fault your
chairs are incredibly ugly.

170
00:10:35,012 --> 00:10:36,411
That's fine.

171
00:10:36,612 --> 00:10:38,807
I won't bring the chairs.
I won't bring anything!

172
00:10:39,012 --> 00:10:42,288
I wouldn't want to ruin the ambiance
over here at grandma's place!

173
00:10:43,972 --> 00:10:46,645
Everything on your application
looks really good.

174
00:10:46,852 --> 00:10:48,524
Just one last question.

175
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:51,849
Will your friends be over here,
partying and hanging out?

176
00:10:52,092 --> 00:10:53,923
Don't worry.
I'm not a party girl.

177
00:10:56,892 --> 00:10:59,167
Don't just be blurting stuff out.

178
00:10:59,372 --> 00:11:02,170
I want you to really think
about your answers.

179
00:11:03,652 --> 00:11:07,201
Call off the roommate search.
Hi. I'll be living here.

180
00:11:07,812 --> 00:11:10,724
Ignore him. He's just some
guy who wants the apartment.

181
00:11:10,932 --> 00:11:13,002
But he's not going to get it.

182
00:11:14,052 --> 00:11:15,849
You took down the shower curtain?

183
00:11:16,052 --> 00:11:17,724
That thing was a hazard!

184
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,411
I'm very safety conscious.

185
00:11:29,852 --> 00:11:32,844
I was just clearing some space
for your stuff.

186
00:11:33,132 --> 00:11:34,042
Thanks.

187
00:11:34,252 --> 00:11:38,928
But listen, Monica and Chandler had a
big fight and they're not moving in.

188
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:42,966
What do you mean, not moving in?
They're still moving in, right?

189
00:11:44,052 --> 00:11:47,522
No, they just had a big blowout
over what to do with my room.

190
00:11:47,732 --> 00:11:50,087
Over a stupid room?

191
00:11:50,452 --> 00:11:54,684
I feel kind of bad for them, but now
I don't have to move in here!

192
00:11:55,012 --> 00:11:57,480
Oh, no. Yeah,
that part's great.

193
00:11:59,692 --> 00:12:02,081
What's all this
about you guys fighting?

194
00:12:03,092 --> 00:12:05,606
Is this really over a room?

195
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,087
That is so silly.

196
00:12:09,452 --> 00:12:10,601
We can handle this.

197
00:12:10,812 --> 00:12:12,404
Apparently not.

198
00:12:12,612 --> 00:12:17,481
And I can't stand by and watch
two people I care about so much. . .

199
00:12:17,732 --> 00:12:20,804
. . .be hurt by something
that is so silly.

200
00:12:23,052 --> 00:12:25,850
Enough of the silliness.

201
00:12:26,052 --> 00:12:27,610
Tell her to stop being silly.

202
00:12:33,292 --> 00:12:35,328
Two very good points.

203
00:12:36,932 --> 00:12:39,890
I've known you both a long time.

204
00:12:40,172 --> 00:12:43,608
And I've never seen either of you
one-millionth as happy. . .

205
00:12:43,852 --> 00:12:45,968
. . .as you've been
since you got together.

206
00:12:46,972 --> 00:12:50,442
Do you really want
to throw that all away over a room?

207
00:12:50,772 --> 00:12:52,763
That is so silly.

208
00:12:53,452 --> 00:12:56,091
What's more important, love. . .

209
00:12:56,732 --> 00:12:58,324
. . .or silliness?

210
00:12:59,732 --> 00:13:02,041
Well, we are fond of the silliness.

211
00:13:02,732 --> 00:13:05,041
But we also have a soft spot
for the love.

212
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:08,320
-Love is the best medicine.
-That's "Iaughter. "

213
00:13:08,532 --> 00:13:09,760
-Why do you do it?
-I don't know.

214
00:13:14,772 --> 00:13:19,004
Now, Chandler, you want
to live with Monica, right?

215
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,360
Yeah, I do.

216
00:13:21,612 --> 00:13:23,887
And, Mon, you want
to live with Chandler?

217
00:13:24,332 --> 00:13:25,128
Yes.

218
00:13:25,332 --> 00:13:28,369
A verbal contract is binding
in the state of New York!

219
00:13:37,572 --> 00:13:40,723
So I understand you're
looking for a place?

220
00:13:42,292 --> 00:13:44,248
No, I'm staying put.

221
00:13:47,012 --> 00:13:50,163
I was going to offer you
my apartment.

222
00:13:51,172 --> 00:13:52,730
Why? Where you going?

223
00:13:54,012 --> 00:13:55,286
I don't know.

224
00:13:59,932 --> 00:14:01,604
You won't believe it.

225
00:14:01,812 --> 00:14:03,723
Monica and Chandler are
moving in again.

226
00:14:03,932 --> 00:14:06,730
That's great news, right?
I mean, for them, right?

227
00:14:08,892 --> 00:14:11,247
But on the bright side,
we get to be roommates again.

228
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:15,450
Yeah. You know, about that. . . .

229
00:14:17,332 --> 00:14:21,007
I really appreciate your offer
to let me move in and everything. . .

230
00:14:21,252 --> 00:14:23,766
. . .but don't you think
it'll be weird?

231
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:28,969
Why? Why would it. . . .
Why would it be weird?

232
00:14:29,732 --> 00:14:32,292
Well, you know,
because of us.

233
00:14:32,932 --> 00:14:34,331
Because of our history.

234
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:36,281
No!

235
00:14:36,772 --> 00:14:38,490
No, no!

236
00:14:38,692 --> 00:14:42,002
It would only be weird
if we were still in "that place. "

237
00:14:42,252 --> 00:14:45,289
Are you still in that place?

238
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:46,841
No, not at all.

239
00:14:47,172 --> 00:14:48,002
Good. Me neither.

240
00:14:48,932 --> 00:14:50,809
So it's not a problem.

241
00:14:51,012 --> 00:14:54,004
We're just two friends
who happen to be roommates.

242
00:14:54,292 --> 00:14:57,489
Okay, but eventually
you and I will be dating.

243
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:02,243
Really? We are?

244
00:15:02,492 --> 00:15:05,768
Yeah. I'll have a boyfriend
and you'll have a girlfriend.

245
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:10,210
That'd be great.

246
00:15:11,052 --> 00:15:14,362
But if you think it'll be okay,
we'll just work out a system.

247
00:15:14,572 --> 00:15:18,008
It'll be like in college.
I'll hang a sign on the door:

248
00:15:18,212 --> 00:15:20,851
"Come back later.
I'm getting lucky. "

249
00:15:26,012 --> 00:15:28,321
Yeah, I didn't think of that.

250
00:15:30,692 --> 00:15:34,128
So are you sure about
this whole moving-in thing?

251
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:38,811
It's a really big step.
And what's the rush?

252
00:15:42,892 --> 00:15:44,166
That's very funny.

253
00:15:44,452 --> 00:15:47,091
He's being silly because
he knows we enjoy the silliness.

254
00:15:49,212 --> 00:15:53,205
No, I'm serious.
Think about it. You move in.

255
00:15:53,532 --> 00:15:58,208
You start fighting over game rooms.
Next thing you know, you break up.

256
00:15:58,572 --> 00:16:01,370
It was just a stupid fight
about a room.

257
00:16:01,652 --> 00:16:03,290
There are no stupid fights!

258
00:16:04,652 --> 00:16:06,688
This isn't about the room.

259
00:16:06,892 --> 00:16:10,123
This is about
what the room represents.

260
00:16:10,652 --> 00:16:14,247
And unfortunately,
this room could destroy you!

261
00:16:15,652 --> 00:16:18,041
-I'm not so worried.
-Me neither.

262
00:16:18,292 --> 00:16:20,044
Fine. It's your life!

263
00:16:21,372 --> 00:16:23,283
I just don't want
to see you break up.

264
00:16:23,492 --> 00:16:27,041
Which you will do
if you move in together.

265
00:16:29,452 --> 00:16:32,250
But if that's what you want,
there's nothing I can do.

266
00:16:32,452 --> 00:16:33,885
Don't do it!

267
00:16:39,052 --> 00:16:41,361
-You still want to move in together?
-Of course.

268
00:16:41,772 --> 00:16:42,887
Ross didn't scare you?

269
00:16:43,092 --> 00:16:45,208
Scared me out of wanting
to live with him.

270
00:16:46,892 --> 00:16:49,042
-I gotta show you something.
-Okay.

271
00:16:52,332 --> 00:16:54,846
Oh, my God!
Someone's killed Square Man!

272
00:16:56,852 --> 00:16:58,604
The Barcalounger can go here.

273
00:16:58,812 --> 00:17:02,361
You can see the TV, and it's still
walking distance to the kitchen.

274
00:17:02,612 --> 00:17:04,284
Oh, that's so sweet.

275
00:17:05,332 --> 00:17:06,481
I want to show you
something too.

276
00:17:06,772 --> 00:17:10,082
You know those big road signs
that say "merge"?

277
00:17:11,132 --> 00:17:15,125
I thought we could get one of those
signs and hang it over our bed.

278
00:17:17,292 --> 00:17:19,442
Because that's you and I together.

279
00:17:20,052 --> 00:17:21,167
"Merge! "

280
00:17:23,052 --> 00:17:24,770
-I love that!
-Really?

281
00:17:24,972 --> 00:17:25,848
"No! "

282
00:17:29,572 --> 00:17:31,927
I found you in my bed

283
00:17:32,812 --> 00:17:35,326
How'd you wind up there?

284
00:17:35,732 --> 00:17:38,200
You are a mystery

285
00:17:38,412 --> 00:17:40,846
Little black curly hair

286
00:17:44,212 --> 00:17:46,726
Little black, little black,
little black

287
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:49,685
Little black curly hair

288
00:17:56,932 --> 00:17:59,765
If you want to receive e-mails
about my upcoming shows. . .

289
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,845
. . .please give me money
so I can buy a computer.

290
00:18:08,492 --> 00:18:09,971
Where are the other guys?

291
00:18:10,252 --> 00:18:12,607
Well, Monica and Chandler
are occupied.

292
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,366
-Fighting?
-The other thing.

293
00:18:16,172 --> 00:18:18,003
It's great they worked things out.

294
00:18:18,212 --> 00:18:20,885
There's no breaking them up,
is there?

295
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:25,009
Can I borrow the key to your house
so I can go make a copy?

296
00:18:25,292 --> 00:18:26,771
-Here.
-Thank you.

297
00:18:27,652 --> 00:18:31,930
Are you sure? Once I make
a copy, there's no turning back.

298
00:18:32,572 --> 00:18:36,884
Yeah, I'm sure. Now get out
of here before I change my mind.

299
00:18:43,492 --> 00:18:46,131
You think moving in
with Rachel is a good idea?

300
00:18:46,372 --> 00:18:48,647
I've been back and forth.

301
00:18:49,172 --> 00:18:51,481
Well, maybe you should go back.

302
00:18:52,252 --> 00:18:54,083
She moves in,
and before you know it. . .

303
00:18:54,292 --> 00:18:56,362
. . .you're right where you don't
want to be, back together.

304
00:18:56,652 --> 00:19:00,611
I don't think so. She's already
talking about dating other guys.

305
00:19:00,812 --> 00:19:04,691
That's not going to work out.
She'll come home all weepy. . .

306
00:19:04,932 --> 00:19:08,163
. . .and you'll be telling her, "Oh,
that's okay. You'll find someone. "

307
00:19:08,372 --> 00:19:10,647
And then, bam! She finds you!

308
00:19:14,212 --> 00:19:15,327
Maybe you're right.

309
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:18,968
Ross, she is definitely
gonna fall in love with you again.

310
00:19:19,212 --> 00:19:20,281
Is that what you want?

311
00:19:20,972 --> 00:19:22,325
Is that what I want?

312
00:19:22,532 --> 00:19:23,681
Yes.

313
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:29,041
Here she comes. I'm gonna
make your life much easier.

314
00:19:29,372 --> 00:19:32,091
The place was closed,
so I'll copy it later.

315
00:19:32,292 --> 00:19:33,441
Or not.

316
00:19:34,412 --> 00:19:36,050
Why don't you move in with me?

317
00:19:37,652 --> 00:19:38,926
Whoa, Joey!

318
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:45,083
Look, I know I scared you with
that whole naked-Thursdays thing. . .

319
00:19:47,092 --> 00:19:48,923
. . .but we don't have to do that.

320
00:19:50,252 --> 00:19:52,322
It would be easier
to move across the hall.

321
00:19:54,292 --> 00:19:57,648
Unless you're thinking about
naked Wednesdays.

322
00:19:58,732 --> 00:20:01,485
Thursday's clearly not good for you.
Pick a day!

323
00:20:08,252 --> 00:20:10,402
Come on in.
Thanks for coming back.

324
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:13,481
There's a lot of people
interested in the room.

325
00:20:13,692 --> 00:20:16,764
But I've narrowed it down,
and you're one of the finalists.

326
00:20:17,172 --> 00:20:22,041
Before I decide, I want to be
sure our personalities match.

327
00:20:22,372 --> 00:20:23,885
So I made up a little test.

328
00:20:24,092 --> 00:20:27,641
I'll say a word, and you say
the first thing that comes to mind.

329
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:30,207
-I can do that.
-Okay, here we go.

330
00:20:30,572 --> 00:20:31,971
-Pillow.
-Fight.

331
00:20:32,172 --> 00:20:33,924
Very good.

332
00:20:35,812 --> 00:20:36,767
"G. "

333
00:20:36,972 --> 00:20:39,167
-String?
-Excellent!

334
00:20:43,332 --> 00:20:44,811
Doggy.

335
00:20:46,372 --> 00:20:47,521
Kitten?

336
00:20:47,812 --> 00:20:48,881
Sorry!

337
00:20:51,452 --> 00:20:53,682
So close, though. Bye-bye!
