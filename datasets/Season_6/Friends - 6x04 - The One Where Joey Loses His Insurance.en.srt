1
00:00:02,612 --> 00:00:05,331
Monica, which of all of this
kitchen stuff is mine?

2
00:00:06,012 --> 00:00:07,491
This bottle opener.

3
00:00:08,212 --> 00:00:10,601
-And. . .?
-And it's a magnet.

4
00:00:15,812 --> 00:00:17,165
Look at that!

5
00:00:18,012 --> 00:00:20,321
How weird is that?
You're moving in with me. . .

6
00:00:20,532 --> 00:00:23,490
. . .and you have the one thing
I don't have.

7
00:00:24,212 --> 00:00:27,488
It's like, in a way,
you complete me.

8
00:00:30,812 --> 00:00:32,165
-Kitchen.
-What?

9
00:00:32,412 --> 00:00:34,926
You complete me kitchen, matey!

10
00:00:37,292 --> 00:00:38,884
I know what you're thinking.

11
00:00:39,812 --> 00:00:43,566
That she'll move in with you, then
fall in love with you, and then. . .

12
00:00:43,812 --> 00:00:47,327
. . .when she finds out you're already
married, she'll be happy.

13
00:00:47,572 --> 00:00:50,291
You know? You're just very sad.

14
00:00:50,932 --> 00:00:53,002
Oh, my God!

15
00:00:54,812 --> 00:00:59,522
I see what this is.
You are in love with Rachel!

16
00:01:00,972 --> 00:01:04,521
It all adds up! You're obsessed
with her. It's always:

17
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:08,611
"What will you do about Rachel?
Why are you moving in with Rachel?

18
00:01:08,812 --> 00:01:13,363
When will you confess your secret
marriage to Rachel?" You want her!

19
00:01:16,212 --> 00:01:18,328
Saved by the bell.

20
00:01:21,772 --> 00:01:23,967
Aren't these candlesticks mine?

21
00:01:24,212 --> 00:01:25,406
No, I bought those.

22
00:01:25,932 --> 00:01:27,047
Oh, right. I forgot.

23
00:01:28,612 --> 00:01:30,091
That you're a liar!

24
00:01:32,572 --> 00:01:36,201
That's great! I'll be there Monday.
And thank you again.

25
00:01:38,412 --> 00:01:41,165
That was the head
of the paleontology department. . .

29
00:01:45,612 --> 00:01:46,840
Wow. What. . .

30
00:01:47,092 --> 00:01:48,047
. . .did he. . .

31
00:01:48,292 --> 00:01:49,202
. . .say?

32
00:01:50,932 --> 00:01:54,845
Remember that paper I had published
last year on sediment flow rate?

33
00:01:55,092 --> 00:01:57,401
-They loved it.
-Well, who wouldn't?

34
00:01:58,292 --> 00:01:59,327
I know!

35
00:02:01,292 --> 00:02:04,045
Anyway, they asked me
to be a guest lecturer.

36
00:02:04,292 --> 00:02:08,649
It's temporary, but if they like me,
it could lead to a full-time job.

37
00:02:08,892 --> 00:02:12,168
How great would that look
on the mailbox? Professor Geller.

38
00:02:12,492 --> 00:02:14,084
Professor and Mrs.

39
00:02:16,212 --> 00:02:17,361
And Mrs.?

40
00:02:19,052 --> 00:02:21,088
You and Ross are still married.

41
00:02:22,772 --> 00:02:23,841
What?

42
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:26,445
Just kidding!

43
00:02:29,012 --> 00:02:29,967
Oh, God!

44
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:35,641
Saved your ass.

45
00:02:37,892 --> 00:02:39,769
The One Where Joey Loses His lnsurance

46
00:02:39,972 --> 00:02:40,961
English Subtitles by
Gelula/SDI

47
00:03:14,372 --> 00:03:15,521
What's the matter?

48
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,688
You know that psychic I see?

49
00:03:20,012 --> 00:03:23,163
She told me I'm gonna die this week,
so I'm bummed.

50
00:03:25,412 --> 00:03:30,247
I know you don't know about readings,
but that's the worst you can get.

51
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:32,927
That's crazy.

52
00:03:33,132 --> 00:03:34,611
She'd say that to you?

53
00:03:34,852 --> 00:03:36,444
You don't believe her, do you?

54
00:03:36,692 --> 00:03:39,445
I don't know. She said
that I'd have triplets. . .

55
00:03:39,692 --> 00:03:42,286
. . .but she also said one of them
would be black.

56
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,321
Just out of curiosity,
did she say how you'd go?

57
00:03:46,532 --> 00:03:49,171
She didn't tell me I'd die
till the end of the session.

58
00:03:49,412 --> 00:03:51,721
I wasn't gonna waste
a whole other hour there!

59
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:53,729
I've only got a week left.

60
00:03:53,972 --> 00:03:56,247
I've really gotta start living now!

61
00:04:00,372 --> 00:04:01,327
Hey, everyone.

62
00:04:02,772 --> 00:04:04,967
Well, today's my first lecture. . .

63
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:08,045
. . .and I wanted to try it out
on you guys. Do you mind?

64
00:04:10,812 --> 00:04:12,006
No, that'd be great!

65
00:04:22,532 --> 00:04:26,241
"There are three primary theories
concerning sediment flow rate.

66
00:04:26,492 --> 00:04:29,928
Each of these theories can be further
subcategorized into two. . . "

67
00:04:30,172 --> 00:04:32,925
This is it.
This is what's gonna kill me.

68
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:40,447
" . . .subcategories. The first
of these subcategories is--"

69
00:04:41,092 --> 00:04:43,731
Are there naked chicks
on that piece of paper?

70
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:47,288
No. Why?

71
00:04:47,492 --> 00:04:51,371
I never seen a guy stare so hard at
something that didn't have chicks on it.

72
00:04:59,172 --> 00:05:01,891
"There are three primary theories. . .

77
00:05:14,612 --> 00:05:16,523
Why don't you open with a joke?

78
00:05:17,892 --> 00:05:21,328
Open with a joke?
It's a university, not a comedy club.

79
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:23,324
Wait a minute, hold the phone.

80
00:05:24,292 --> 00:05:26,362
You're not talking
about Chuckles University?

81
00:05:28,892 --> 00:05:30,245
Come on, we're kidding.

82
00:05:30,492 --> 00:05:32,403
You know what might make it
less boring?

83
00:05:32,652 --> 00:05:33,687
Thank you.

84
00:05:34,572 --> 00:05:36,608
Some visual aids.

85
00:05:37,332 --> 00:05:40,369
-You know what's a good visual aid?
-Don't say naked chicks.

86
00:05:41,372 --> 00:05:42,168
Why not?

87
00:05:43,532 --> 00:05:46,171
I don't even know why I talk
to you guys about it.

88
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:49,609
I'm just gonna do it on my own,
with no naked chicks.

89
00:05:49,852 --> 00:05:52,525
That's the way I did it
till I was 1 9.

90
00:05:59,372 --> 00:06:00,521
Any good mail?

91
00:06:00,732 --> 00:06:02,529
Something from
the Screen Actors Guild.

92
00:06:02,772 --> 00:06:06,731
It's probably a residual check.
Can you open it? I got. . . .

93
00:06:08,212 --> 00:06:10,009
"Benefits lapsed. "

94
00:06:10,252 --> 00:06:11,321
That's weird.

95
00:06:11,532 --> 00:06:14,524
I don't remember being in a movie
called Benefits Lapsed.

96
00:06:15,612 --> 00:06:19,571
It's not a check. Your health
insurance expired because. . .

97
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:23,122
-. . .you didn't work enough last year.
-Let me see that.

98
00:06:24,172 --> 00:06:26,128
Oh, I can't believe this!

99
00:06:26,332 --> 00:06:27,651
This sucks!

100
00:06:28,572 --> 00:06:31,325
When I had insurance,
I could get hit by a bus. . .

101
00:06:31,532 --> 00:06:33,250
. . .or catch on fire, you know?

102
00:06:33,492 --> 00:06:36,211
And it wouldn't matter.
Now I gotta be careful?

103
00:06:37,572 --> 00:06:39,961
I'm sorry. There's never
a good time to have to. . .

104
00:06:40,212 --> 00:06:42,282
. . .stop catching on fire.

105
00:06:43,892 --> 00:06:45,166
All right, well. . .

106
00:06:45,412 --> 00:06:47,642
. . .I guess I gotta go see my agent.

107
00:06:47,892 --> 00:06:50,725
Make sure to look both ways
before you cross the street.

108
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:54,445
"Make sure to look both ways
before you cross the street. "

109
00:07:01,692 --> 00:07:03,444
Hey, you're still alive!

110
00:07:05,252 --> 00:07:06,526
How are you feeling?

111
00:07:06,732 --> 00:07:09,849
It's so exhausting, waiting for death.

112
00:07:10,132 --> 00:07:12,930
Oh, by the way, do you think you--

113
00:07:16,412 --> 00:07:17,640
What are you doing?

114
00:07:18,292 --> 00:07:20,522
Preparing you for--
Didn't you think I was dead?

115
00:07:20,772 --> 00:07:22,410
Did that not come off?

116
00:07:23,332 --> 00:07:26,847
Yeah, scared the hell out of me.
I thought we'd lost you forever.

117
00:07:27,092 --> 00:07:29,845
-You wanna lie down?
-Yeah, thanks.

118
00:07:30,412 --> 00:07:31,845
Can you do me a favor?

119
00:07:32,092 --> 00:07:34,128
Wake me up in a couple hours.

120
00:07:34,332 --> 00:07:36,129
You know, if you can.

121
00:07:44,292 --> 00:07:45,771
Did you take these back?

122
00:07:47,732 --> 00:07:50,610
I liked them so much
that I bought some for myself.

123
00:07:50,812 --> 00:07:52,928
They're really great, aren't they?

124
00:07:53,132 --> 00:07:54,167
I love them.

125
00:07:55,612 --> 00:07:56,647
Nice try.

126
00:08:00,212 --> 00:08:01,361
How'd the lecture go?

127
00:08:01,612 --> 00:08:03,523
It went great.

128
00:08:03,732 --> 00:08:07,441
And I didn't need any jokes
or naked chicks either.

129
00:08:07,772 --> 00:08:10,650
That's great. I'm sorry
we weren't supportive before.

130
00:08:10,892 --> 00:08:13,770
I knew I just had to let
the material speak for itself.

131
00:08:14,012 --> 00:08:16,970
Everyone's all, "Ross, you have
to be funny and sexy. "

132
00:08:17,212 --> 00:08:19,282
Well, I proved them wrong!

133
00:08:20,372 --> 00:08:23,125
And now I'm gonna pass
the news on to Joey and Chandler.

134
00:08:23,372 --> 00:08:25,966
-That you're not funny or sexy?
-That's right!

135
00:08:31,372 --> 00:08:35,047
-Hey, Estelle, listen--
-Well, well, well.

136
00:08:35,332 --> 00:08:36,811
Joey Tribbiani.

137
00:08:37,052 --> 00:08:39,008
So you came back, huh?

138
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:41,641
They think they can do better,
but they all. . .

139
00:08:41,892 --> 00:08:44,565
. . .come crawling back to Estelle.

140
00:08:46,012 --> 00:08:47,923
What are you talking about?

141
00:08:48,332 --> 00:08:50,721
I never left you.
You've always been my agent.

142
00:08:50,972 --> 00:08:51,768
Really?

143
00:08:53,292 --> 00:08:56,329
Oh, well, no harm no foul.

144
00:08:56,892 --> 00:09:00,965
Look, you gotta get me some work.
I lost my health insurance.

145
00:09:01,212 --> 00:09:04,329
All right, first thing we gotta do:
damage control.

146
00:09:04,572 --> 00:09:06,847
-Why?
-Well, I think. . .

147
00:09:07,092 --> 00:09:09,162
. . .someone out there. . .

148
00:09:09,412 --> 00:09:12,643
. . .may have been bad-mouthing you
all over town.

149
00:09:14,612 --> 00:09:15,761
The bastard!

150
00:09:25,612 --> 00:09:28,729
So Estelle lined up a bunch
of auditions for me tomorrow.

151
00:09:28,932 --> 00:09:31,765
And I'll have my health insurance
back in no time.

152
00:09:32,812 --> 00:09:36,282
That's great, but shouldn't you
be on the toilet right now?

153
00:09:40,492 --> 00:09:42,130
What's wrong with you?

154
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:43,128
Nothing.

155
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:47,769
I got this blinding pain in my stomach
when I was lifting weights before.

156
00:09:48,012 --> 00:09:50,924
And then I passed out. . .

157
00:09:51,172 --> 00:09:53,128
. . .and I haven't been able
to stand up since.

158
00:09:53,412 --> 00:09:56,085
But I don't think
it's anything serious.

159
00:09:56,292 --> 00:09:59,045
This sounds like a hernia.
Go to the doctor.

160
00:09:59,292 --> 00:10:00,088
No way.

161
00:10:00,332 --> 00:10:04,769
If I go to the doctor, it'll be for
this thing sticking out of my stomach!

162
00:10:08,772 --> 00:10:09,966
That's a hernia.

163
00:10:10,172 --> 00:10:12,766
Why'd I have to start
working out again?

164
00:10:13,492 --> 00:10:15,210
Damn you, 1 5s!

165
00:10:19,172 --> 00:10:21,527
The lecture doesn't end
for 1 5 minutes.

166
00:10:21,772 --> 00:10:23,922
-We can sneak in and watch.
-Good.

167
00:10:24,172 --> 00:10:26,811
Oh, hey, look!
There's some Kappa Kappa Deltas.

168
00:10:27,052 --> 00:10:27,962
I was a Kappa.

169
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:29,850
Hey, sisters!

170
00:10:32,092 --> 00:10:33,969
Wow, we really are bitches.

171
00:10:37,212 --> 00:10:41,444
Right. So when Rigby got his samples
back from the laboratory. . .

172
00:10:42,212 --> 00:10:44,168
. . .he made a startling discovery.

173
00:10:46,452 --> 00:10:50,570
What he believed to be igneous
was, in fact, sedimentary.

174
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:54,650
Imagine his consternation when--

175
00:10:58,412 --> 00:11:00,448
Oh, bloody hell.

176
00:11:04,212 --> 00:11:06,442
What the hell are you doing?

177
00:11:07,012 --> 00:11:08,570
Look, I was nervous.

178
00:11:08,812 --> 00:11:11,531
You guys had me all worried
I was gonna be boring.

179
00:11:11,732 --> 00:11:14,963
I got up there and they were
all, like, staring at me.

180
00:11:15,212 --> 00:11:18,807
I opened my mouth and this
British accent just came out.

181
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,523
Yeah, and not a very good one.

182
00:11:21,732 --> 00:11:23,529
Will you, please. . .?

183
00:11:23,772 --> 00:11:25,569
Dr. Geller? Kurt Rathman.

184
00:11:25,812 --> 00:11:28,167
I'm a paleontology professor here.

185
00:11:28,812 --> 00:11:31,201
Do you have a moment
to talk about your lecture?

186
00:11:31,412 --> 00:11:34,131
I'm sorry, I've got plans
with my sister.

187
00:11:34,372 --> 00:11:36,249
Monica Geller.

188
00:11:37,812 --> 00:11:40,963
Right. Will you excuse us
for one moment?

189
00:11:41,372 --> 00:11:44,011
-What are you doing?
-You can have an accent, but I can't?

190
00:11:44,612 --> 00:11:47,046
Top of the morning to you, laddies!

191
00:11:47,412 --> 00:11:49,846
Would you just please stop?

192
00:11:50,892 --> 00:11:54,931
Yes, yes, Bombay is very, very nice
this time of year.

193
00:12:10,972 --> 00:12:12,803
Hey, will you grab me a cruller?

194
00:12:14,532 --> 00:12:15,647
Sit down!

195
00:12:16,732 --> 00:12:18,768
Will you go to the hospital?

196
00:12:19,012 --> 00:12:20,650
Hernia operations cost. . .

197
00:12:20,892 --> 00:12:22,530
. . .a lot probably, okay?

198
00:12:22,732 --> 00:12:27,123
Besides, it's getting darker and more
painful. That means it's healing.

199
00:12:27,972 --> 00:12:29,724
Look, I'll loan you the money.

200
00:12:29,972 --> 00:12:33,169
Just go to the hospital and
let's just get that thing. . .

201
00:12:33,412 --> 00:12:34,891
. . .pushed back in.

202
00:12:35,532 --> 00:12:38,569
Thank you, but it'd take me
forever to pay you back.

203
00:12:38,812 --> 00:12:40,723
I don't want that
hanging over my head.

204
00:12:40,932 --> 00:12:43,048
Besides, when my
insurance kicks in. . .

205
00:12:43,292 --> 00:12:46,045
. . .I can get all the free
operations I want.

206
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:49,204
I'll probably start
with that laser eye surgery.

207
00:12:53,332 --> 00:12:54,128
What's going on?

208
00:12:54,372 --> 00:12:59,002
Joey's got a hernia, but it's nothing
a little laser eye surgery won't fix.

209
00:12:59,932 --> 00:13:02,571
I'm telling you,
if I put my hand on my stomach. . .

210
00:13:02,812 --> 00:13:04,882
. . .it doesn't hurt that bad.

211
00:13:05,332 --> 00:13:07,004
Hey, maybe you'll die!

212
00:13:09,412 --> 00:13:11,209
Chandler, I'm scared.

213
00:13:11,612 --> 00:13:13,125
No, we can go together.

214
00:13:13,332 --> 00:13:17,166
Just don't wait too long, because I'm
out of here sometime before Friday.

215
00:13:18,212 --> 00:13:19,725
But I don't want to die.

216
00:13:20,012 --> 00:13:23,049
It'll be fun. We'll come back
and haunt these guys!

217
00:13:28,812 --> 00:13:30,928
-Give me them!
-No, they are mine!

218
00:13:31,132 --> 00:13:33,123
-You stole them from me!
-You stole them from me!

219
00:13:33,332 --> 00:13:34,321
Give me them!

220
00:13:37,532 --> 00:13:38,851
Just wanna each take one?

221
00:13:39,532 --> 00:13:41,966
Yeah, that seems fair.
We never use them.

222
00:13:43,612 --> 00:13:46,570
Look, I really need
some help, okay?

223
00:13:46,812 --> 00:13:50,043
Why did I have to speak
in a British accent?

224
00:13:50,852 --> 00:13:51,648
What do I do?

225
00:13:51,852 --> 00:13:54,969
Why don't you phase it out?
Yeah, phase the accent out.

226
00:13:55,212 --> 00:13:58,409
People will think you're
adjusting to life in America.

227
00:13:58,812 --> 00:14:00,723
Come on.
No one will even notice.

228
00:14:00,932 --> 00:14:03,366
They're probably not even
listening to you.

229
00:14:05,332 --> 00:14:06,765
They're not listening to me?

230
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,446
Of course they're listening to you.

231
00:14:10,012 --> 00:14:11,331
Everybody listens to you.

232
00:14:11,932 --> 00:14:15,004
Monica, do you think I should
try this phasing-out thing?

233
00:14:15,252 --> 00:14:16,731
I think you look fine.

234
00:14:20,612 --> 00:14:22,125
Whenever you're ready.

235
00:14:24,012 --> 00:14:25,240
Hey, Timmy.

236
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,721
I've got a surprise. . .

237
00:14:28,972 --> 00:14:30,041
. . .for you.

238
00:14:30,532 --> 00:14:31,521
Hold it.
I'm sorry.

239
00:14:31,932 --> 00:14:35,720
The surprise is a new swing set.
If you could play it less intense.

240
00:14:35,932 --> 00:14:37,763
Oh, yeah. Sure, no problem.

241
00:14:38,012 --> 00:14:39,764
Just hold on one second.

242
00:14:46,292 --> 00:14:48,203
Hey, Timmy.

243
00:14:48,412 --> 00:14:51,609
I've got a surprise for you!

244
00:14:51,852 --> 00:14:52,762
Oh, my God!

245
00:14:58,812 --> 00:15:01,929
So that's why I feed my dog
Purina One.

246
00:15:02,532 --> 00:15:04,170
Pick up a bag today.

247
00:15:06,012 --> 00:15:08,446
-That's where you pick up the bag.
-Exactly.

248
00:15:09,612 --> 00:15:13,400
The line is, "Pick up a bag,"
so you need to pick up the bag.

249
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:16,570
Or I could just point to it.

250
00:15:17,812 --> 00:15:21,600
Purina One. Point to a bag today.

251
00:15:25,612 --> 00:15:27,011
I didn't get it, did l?

252
00:15:33,172 --> 00:15:34,571
Joey Tribbiani.

253
00:15:34,812 --> 00:15:37,007
I'm here to audition for "Man. "

254
00:15:38,252 --> 00:15:39,321
You mean "Dying Man. "

255
00:15:43,732 --> 00:15:46,724
-Do it one more time.
-Really? Really? Okay.

256
00:15:50,212 --> 00:15:54,569
Hello, Ross? This is Dr. McNeely
from the Fake Accent University.

257
00:15:54,812 --> 00:15:57,121
We'd like you
to come onboard full-time!

258
00:16:02,372 --> 00:16:03,646
Listen to this!

259
00:16:04,292 --> 00:16:06,328
My reading was wrong.
I'm not going to die.

260
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:07,806
Really? How do you know?

261
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:09,371
My psychic is dead!

262
00:16:11,612 --> 00:16:13,443
She must have read
the cards wrong.

263
00:16:13,692 --> 00:16:15,171
I'm sorry.

264
00:16:15,372 --> 00:16:17,010
Better her than me.

265
00:16:17,532 --> 00:16:19,409
Hey, let's bake cookies!

266
00:16:25,012 --> 00:16:27,207
Listen, I'm really glad
you got the part.

267
00:16:28,972 --> 00:16:30,644
Are you sure you can do this?

268
00:16:31,212 --> 00:16:32,964
And thanks for coming with me.

269
00:16:33,212 --> 00:16:36,010
And thanks again
for helping me take a shower.

270
00:16:38,212 --> 00:16:41,443
Now, is that
"never talking about it again"?

271
00:16:43,612 --> 00:16:45,091
We're ready for you.

272
00:16:45,812 --> 00:16:48,246
This is Alex.
He'll be playing your son.

273
00:16:48,492 --> 00:16:49,527
Hi, Alex.

274
00:16:49,772 --> 00:16:52,650
As you can see, my hands
are not in my pants.

275
00:16:57,172 --> 00:17:00,164
All right, Alex.
Now, when Joey says his line. . .

276
00:17:00,412 --> 00:17:03,927
. . . "Take good care of your mama, son,"
that's your cue to cry. Got it?

277
00:17:04,172 --> 00:17:05,571
All right, let's do this.

278
00:17:09,732 --> 00:17:11,848
Scene five, take one.

279
00:17:13,292 --> 00:17:14,520
And action!

280
00:17:14,732 --> 00:17:16,882
Take good care of your mama, son.

281
00:17:24,772 --> 00:17:26,842
Take good care of your mama, son.

282
00:17:30,612 --> 00:17:31,681
Come on, son.

283
00:17:32,172 --> 00:17:34,208
Your mama's good people.

284
00:17:35,092 --> 00:17:35,922
Cut!

285
00:17:36,172 --> 00:17:38,845
Alex, remember, you're
supposed to cry.

286
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:41,128
Can you cry for us this time?

287
00:17:41,612 --> 00:17:43,443
All right. From the top.

288
00:17:46,092 --> 00:17:48,367
Scene five, take two.

289
00:17:49,172 --> 00:17:50,844
Take 36 is up.

290
00:17:51,892 --> 00:17:53,450
Let's try this again.

291
00:17:53,812 --> 00:17:54,927
You ready, Joe?

292
00:17:55,132 --> 00:17:57,726
One thing, is it all right
if I scream. . .

293
00:17:57,932 --> 00:17:59,763
. . .right up until
you say, "Action"?

294
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:01,442
Sure.

295
00:18:04,012 --> 00:18:06,970
-Action!
-Take good care of your mama, son.

296
00:18:09,612 --> 00:18:10,681
Cut!

297
00:18:11,812 --> 00:18:16,010
I'm sorry. Why don't you lift up your
shirt? Take a look at this, kiddo.

298
00:18:19,972 --> 00:18:23,169
We have a crying child!
Roll the damn cameras!

299
00:18:29,532 --> 00:18:31,966
-Hello, is Ross there?
-No, he's not. Can I take a message?

300
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:34,567
Yes, this is Russell,
Ross ' divorce lawyer.

301
00:18:34,812 --> 00:18:39,010
Since I haven't heard from him, I
assume he's giving the marriage a try.

302
00:18:39,492 --> 00:18:41,005
Ross got married again?

303
00:18:44,772 --> 00:18:47,923
All right, keep going.
We are phasing the accent out.

304
00:18:48,172 --> 00:18:49,730
Phasing it out.

305
00:18:50,412 --> 00:18:54,644
"So without retesting their results
in the laboratory. . .

306
00:18:55,212 --> 00:18:58,204
. . .the team would never
have identified. . .

307
00:19:00,812 --> 00:19:04,646
. . .the initial errors
in their carbon dating. . .

308
00:19:04,892 --> 00:19:06,371
. . .analysis. "

309
00:19:08,572 --> 00:19:10,483
Were there any questions
at this point?

310
00:19:12,332 --> 00:19:14,209
What's happening to your accent?

311
00:19:16,932 --> 00:19:19,765
Come again? What's this nonsense?

312
00:19:23,692 --> 00:19:26,286
All right. I'm not English.

313
00:19:27,892 --> 00:19:29,723
I'm from Long lsland.

314
00:19:30,612 --> 00:19:33,524
I was really nervous,
and the accent. . .

315
00:19:33,732 --> 00:19:35,211
. . .just came out.

316
00:19:35,692 --> 00:19:37,091
I'm sorry.

317
00:19:38,892 --> 00:19:41,725
So if we could just
get back to the lecture.

318
00:19:43,972 --> 00:19:45,530
Were there any questions?

319
00:19:48,132 --> 00:19:49,690
About paleontology?

320
00:19:52,972 --> 00:19:55,532
I was just trying to make
a good first impression.

321
00:19:55,772 --> 00:19:59,765
Obviously, I screwed up. But what
you guys think of me is important. . .

322
00:20:00,012 --> 00:20:02,924
. . .because I'm hoping to get
a permanent job here.

323
00:20:03,172 --> 00:20:07,165
So if you'd just give me another
chance to make a good impression--

324
00:20:07,892 --> 00:20:09,928
Ross! Are you crazy?

325
00:20:10,172 --> 00:20:13,164
I am still your wife?
Were you just never gonna tell me?

326
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,562
What the hell is wrong with you?

327
00:20:15,812 --> 00:20:17,803
I could just kill you!

328
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,610
Well, hello, Rachel!

329
00:20:33,172 --> 00:20:35,208
You've really done this before?

330
00:20:35,892 --> 00:20:38,360
You just take a big, big swing, okay?

331
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,330
Now, don't hold back.

332
00:20:45,252 --> 00:20:46,048
What are you doing?

333
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:49,728
We're just celebrating that Joey
got his health insurance back.

334
00:20:50,612 --> 00:20:51,488
Oh, all right.
