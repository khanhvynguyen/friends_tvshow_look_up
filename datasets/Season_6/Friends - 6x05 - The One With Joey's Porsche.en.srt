1
00:00:03,853 --> 00:00:07,289
I cannot believe that you didn't
tell me we are still married!

2
00:00:07,493 --> 00:00:09,165
Look, I was going to tell you.

3
00:00:09,373 --> 00:00:11,807
When? After the birth
of our first secret child?

4
00:00:13,493 --> 00:00:16,166
Ross didn't get the annulment.
We are still married!

5
00:00:16,373 --> 00:00:18,284
-You're kidding?
-Oh, my God!

6
00:00:21,253 --> 00:00:25,326
It wasn't my best decision, but I
couldn't face another failed marriage.

7
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:29,162
At what point did you think
this was a successful marriage?

8
00:00:31,653 --> 00:00:35,965
Rach, come on. If you think about it,
it's actually kind of funny.

9
00:00:38,053 --> 00:00:40,283
Maybe it's best not to think about it.

10
00:00:41,573 --> 00:00:45,361
This is inexcusable.
I'm shocked to my very core.

11
00:00:47,053 --> 00:00:49,123
Phoebe, I told her you already knew.

12
00:00:52,773 --> 00:00:54,684
Another lie. You have a sickness!

13
00:00:57,093 --> 00:01:00,290
For my own peace of mind,
are you married to any more of us?

14
00:01:02,493 --> 00:01:04,211
The One With Joey's Porshe

16
00:01:39,493 --> 00:01:41,085
Someone left their keys.

17
00:01:41,573 --> 00:01:43,962
To a Porsche.

18
00:01:44,893 --> 00:01:47,407
-Are these yours?
-Yeah. That's what I drive.

19
00:01:48,973 --> 00:01:52,204
I make 4 bucks an hour.
I saved up for 350 years.

20
00:01:58,133 --> 00:01:59,725
Did anybody lose their keys?

21
00:01:59,933 --> 00:02:01,571
Put them in the lost and found.

22
00:02:01,773 --> 00:02:03,411
There's a lost and found?

23
00:02:04,693 --> 00:02:06,206
My shoe!

24
00:02:07,613 --> 00:02:09,285
You left a shoe here?

25
00:02:09,493 --> 00:02:14,009
I didn't realize till I got home.
I wasn't gonna walk back with one shoe.

26
00:02:14,853 --> 00:02:18,323
I'll go find that guy's car
and leave a note on the windshield.

27
00:02:18,533 --> 00:02:21,809
When he comes back for his keys,
I'll give him your shoe.

28
00:02:22,013 --> 00:02:22,809
Great. Thanks.

29
00:02:25,293 --> 00:02:27,807
Oh, good. You guys are here.
Listen.

30
00:02:28,013 --> 00:02:32,131
How would you like to spend tomorrow
taking care of three cute puppies?

31
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,449
My, God! What a fun day!
Sounds great!

32
00:02:34,653 --> 00:02:36,211
Yeah, all right.

33
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,723
I'll bring them by tomorrow morning.

34
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:42,009
By the way, they're not
actually puppies.

35
00:02:42,253 --> 00:02:44,767
They're Frank and Alice's triplets.
See you.

36
00:02:46,093 --> 00:02:47,128
What?

37
00:02:47,453 --> 00:02:50,286
Please, please, please?
Frank and Alice. . .

38
00:02:50,493 --> 00:02:53,849
. . .asked me to babysit them.
I'm nervous. I've never done that.

39
00:02:54,053 --> 00:02:55,611
Don't worry. We'll do it.

40
00:02:55,853 --> 00:02:59,562
I'm gonna pass, because I was
kind of iffy when it was puppies.

41
00:03:00,853 --> 00:03:04,243
Come on, Chandler. It'll give us
great practice for when. . .

42
00:03:04,493 --> 00:03:06,609
. . .people with babies come to visit.

43
00:03:11,373 --> 00:03:12,249
Nice car.

44
00:03:12,453 --> 00:03:14,409
It's not mine.

45
00:03:16,453 --> 00:03:19,411
-I love your car.
-Yeah. It's mine.

46
00:03:21,013 --> 00:03:24,005
-I bet it's fast.
-Me too. Yeah.

47
00:03:24,493 --> 00:03:26,006
And comfortable.

48
00:03:26,693 --> 00:03:28,411
-You like leather seats?
-Yeah.

49
00:03:31,213 --> 00:03:32,043
It's got them!

50
00:03:36,093 --> 00:03:39,608
So I still have boxes here.

51
00:03:40,093 --> 00:03:42,368
I still have boxes at Ross' .

52
00:03:42,573 --> 00:03:44,404
And I have nowhere to live.

53
00:03:44,613 --> 00:03:47,002
I could so easily freak out right now.

54
00:03:48,053 --> 00:03:52,524
What about me? Denise is leaving town
for a while. I don't have a roommate.

55
00:03:55,613 --> 00:03:59,208
Well, maybe I could be
your roommate, Pheebs.

56
00:04:00,413 --> 00:04:02,563
Maybe you could be my roommate!

57
00:04:03,213 --> 00:04:05,602
Well, there's an idea!

58
00:04:05,853 --> 00:04:07,047
That would be great!

59
00:04:07,253 --> 00:04:11,326
-How long is Denise gone for?
-She said she'd be back December 26th.

60
00:04:11,533 --> 00:04:13,125
December 26th.

61
00:04:13,373 --> 00:04:14,488
Maybe she's Santa Claus.

62
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:25,123
Oh, look who it is.
My husband, the apple of my eye.

63
00:04:25,853 --> 00:04:28,731
Okay, I got us a court date
for tomorrow at 2. . .

64
00:04:28,933 --> 00:04:31,163
. . .and I picked up all the forms.

65
00:04:31,413 --> 00:04:32,687
I'll take care of it.

66
00:04:32,893 --> 00:04:37,250
Sure, if you say you'll take care
of it, I have no reason to doubt you.

67
00:04:37,613 --> 00:04:39,205
Give me those forms.

68
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:43,088
I'm gonna do this my way, and I
don't wanna hear a peep out of you.

69
00:04:43,293 --> 00:04:45,602
-Okay, Rach, but--
-You're peeping!

70
00:04:50,213 --> 00:04:51,646
Ross, I just got--

71
00:04:52,053 --> 00:04:54,203
-Why did you do this?
-I told you--

72
00:04:54,453 --> 00:04:56,967
I don't wanna hear
"three failed marriages. "

73
00:04:57,173 --> 00:04:59,846
If you'd had two failed marriages,
you'd understand.

74
00:05:00,053 --> 00:05:02,123
Thanks to you, I'm halfway there.

75
00:05:05,493 --> 00:05:09,691
Oh, I am so mad, Ross! I don't think
I've ever been this angry!

76
00:05:11,173 --> 00:05:13,243
What about when I said
we were on a break?

77
00:05:20,693 --> 00:05:21,967
Pheebs, how's it going?

78
00:05:22,173 --> 00:05:25,131
I'm okay. Are they having fun?
Am I talking too fast?

79
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,607
No. You sound like me.

80
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:30,888
It's going great. Look at Chandler
with Little Baby Girl Chandler.

81
00:05:31,613 --> 00:05:35,811
Little Baby Girl Chandler. Where have
I heard that before? Oh, Coach Rubin.

82
00:05:41,493 --> 00:05:45,805
Pheebs, when you're done over there,
we've got a situation over here too.

83
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:49,646
No. We are all responsible
for our own babies.

84
00:05:49,853 --> 00:05:53,050
That's where you're wrong.
We've been playing them man-to-man.

85
00:05:53,293 --> 00:05:55,727
We should really be playing
a zone defense.

86
00:05:56,453 --> 00:05:57,966
What do you mean?

87
00:05:58,173 --> 00:06:02,212
Things'll go smoother if we each have a
zone. Phoebe, be in charge of wiping.

88
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,205
Mon, be in charge of diapering.

89
00:06:05,413 --> 00:06:09,645
I'll be in charge of looking at how cute
they are when they put their hands. . . .

90
00:06:11,373 --> 00:06:14,012
Sounds great, but you should be
in charge of wiping.

91
00:06:14,253 --> 00:06:16,972
Okay, I'm a rookie.
I should not be in the end zone.

92
00:06:26,773 --> 00:06:31,369
This is so great. This is exactly how
we set the plates at the restaurant.

93
00:06:32,213 --> 00:06:34,283
Yeah? Well, this is not
what I ordered.

94
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:39,762
Hey, guys.

95
00:06:39,973 --> 00:06:40,769
Hey, babies.

96
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:43,852
I'm having the best morning.

97
00:06:44,093 --> 00:06:46,482
That Porsche I've got the keys to?
Still there.

98
00:06:46,693 --> 00:06:50,003
Shocking, since you
still have the keys.

99
00:06:51,173 --> 00:06:54,006
You should see the treatment I get
with that car.

100
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:57,523
People are friendly. They wanna talk.
And not just about the car.

101
00:06:57,773 --> 00:06:59,809
One guy advised me
on my equity investments.

102
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:01,042
What equity investments?

103
00:07:01,253 --> 00:07:04,211
The ones that got me the Porsche.
Will you keep up?

104
00:07:08,013 --> 00:07:12,404
If people see me just standing there,
they're gonna think I don't own it.

105
00:07:12,613 --> 00:07:15,923
So I figure I'll wash it.
Monica, you got a bucket and soap?

106
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:19,205
Oh, yeah. I got soap
and sponges and rags. . .

107
00:07:19,413 --> 00:07:23,167
. . .and carnauba wax
and polishing compound.

108
00:07:23,773 --> 00:07:25,172
You don't even have a car.

109
00:07:25,573 --> 00:07:29,805
I know. Once there was a dirty car in
front of the building, so I washed it.

110
00:07:31,053 --> 00:07:33,567
-And?
-And six others.

111
00:07:33,773 --> 00:07:34,808
There you are.

112
00:07:38,413 --> 00:07:40,802
Yeah, she tops out at 1 30.

113
00:07:41,813 --> 00:07:44,964
That's just in the city.
I get her up to 1 60 upstate.

114
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,403
Really? You got a place upstate?

115
00:07:47,893 --> 00:07:49,167
Sure.

116
00:07:50,893 --> 00:07:53,532
-All right. See you later.
-Okay. Take it easy.

117
00:07:55,213 --> 00:07:57,773
Hey. That's my car.

118
00:07:58,373 --> 00:07:59,601
Really?

119
00:08:00,093 --> 00:08:01,811
Just give me five more minutes.

120
00:08:03,573 --> 00:08:04,722
What are you doing?

121
00:08:04,973 --> 00:08:07,931
I found the keys, and now
I'm just polishing her up.

122
00:08:08,693 --> 00:08:11,526
-But it's my car.
-Yeah, but it's my wax.

123
00:08:13,013 --> 00:08:15,607
Listen, I don't come to the city much.

124
00:08:15,853 --> 00:08:19,289
I don't know if you're crazy or
if this is some street theater. . .

125
00:08:19,573 --> 00:08:21,803
. . .but could I have my keys?

126
00:08:22,053 --> 00:08:25,011
Sure. Yeah.
I'll save your parking spot.

127
00:08:25,253 --> 00:08:26,811
I'm not coming back.

128
00:08:27,053 --> 00:08:28,850
-Why not?
-I live upstate.

129
00:08:29,413 --> 00:08:30,892
Yeah, so did l.

130
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:35,204
I don't know why I was so nervous. . .

131
00:08:35,413 --> 00:08:38,325
. . .and why Frank and Alice complain.
This is easy.

132
00:08:38,533 --> 00:08:41,172
Yeah, two hours, a lifetime,
that's the same.

133
00:08:43,053 --> 00:08:45,647
Check it out!
When the babies wake up. . .

134
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:47,611
. . .they can meet Krog!

135
00:08:50,013 --> 00:08:52,288
That thing could put
someone's eye out.

136
00:08:52,493 --> 00:08:55,610
He can do more than that.
He can destroy the universe.

137
00:08:56,253 --> 00:08:59,051
They could swallow
one of those little parts.

138
00:08:59,293 --> 00:09:02,808
Also, look at his smooth area.
That's just gonna mess them up.

139
00:09:03,693 --> 00:09:06,412
They won't swallow anything.
You're too overprotective.

140
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:10,162
When I was a kid, my mom used to throw
me into a pile of broken glass.

141
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:14,210
-What?
-Glass, sand, whatever.

142
00:09:16,213 --> 00:09:18,647
Look at little Leslie stretching
in her sleep.

143
00:09:18,893 --> 00:09:20,087
Oh, it's so cute.

144
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:23,171
I wonder when you stop putting
both legs behind your head.

145
00:09:23,373 --> 00:09:24,488
I can still do that.

146
00:09:26,213 --> 00:09:28,408
How are you still single?

147
00:09:30,293 --> 00:09:34,730
I thought about it, and maybe you're
right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.

148
00:09:34,933 --> 00:09:38,608
-What made you change your mind?
-I swallowed his sonic blaster gun.

149
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,205
How did that happen?

150
00:09:41,693 --> 00:09:43,649
I was trying to prove
that I was right.

151
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:46,204
And it turns out I was wrong. . .

152
00:09:46,413 --> 00:09:48,404
. . .and now it's lodged in my throat.

153
00:09:52,813 --> 00:09:55,532
This whole time we were
concentrating on the babies. . .

154
00:09:55,773 --> 00:09:58,287
. . .and no one was watching Chandler!

155
00:10:01,253 --> 00:10:03,642
You are asking the court
for an annulment?

156
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,606
Yes, Your Honor. Here are
our forms, all filled out.

157
00:10:06,813 --> 00:10:08,883
So based on your petition. . .

158
00:10:09,093 --> 00:10:11,653
. . .you are seeking an annulment
on the grounds. . .

159
00:10:11,893 --> 00:10:14,453
. . .that "Mr. Geller
is mentally unstable. "

160
00:10:17,453 --> 00:10:20,013
Fine. I'm mentally unstable.

161
00:10:20,693 --> 00:10:24,163
And based on the fact that "Mr. Geller
is an intravenous drug user. "

162
00:10:25,373 --> 00:10:28,490
-What?
-Yes. Heroin and crack.

163
00:10:30,453 --> 00:10:32,762
Crack isn't even an intravenous drug.

164
00:10:32,973 --> 00:10:34,372
Well, you would know.

165
00:10:36,293 --> 00:10:38,648
Now, it also says here that you. . .

166
00:10:38,893 --> 00:10:41,612
. . . "Iied about your sexual preference
before marriage. "

167
00:10:41,853 --> 00:10:42,763
Oh, come on.

168
00:10:42,973 --> 00:10:45,203
Ross, please. I found the magazines.

169
00:10:47,053 --> 00:10:50,409
And, finally, that you were
"unable to consummate the marriage. "

170
00:10:50,653 --> 00:10:54,202
Well, that makes sense since
you're gay and addicted to heroin.

171
00:10:55,813 --> 00:10:58,122
You know, I'm sorry, this is insane.

172
00:10:58,373 --> 00:11:02,048
I'm not addicted to heroin,
I'm not gay, and there is no problem. . .

173
00:11:02,253 --> 00:11:04,813
. . .with my ability
to consummate anything.

174
00:11:05,053 --> 00:11:08,011
I'll consummate this marriage
right here, right now!

175
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,409
That won't be necessary.

176
00:11:11,893 --> 00:11:15,010
And when we were dating,
we consummated like bunnies.

177
00:11:15,973 --> 00:11:20,091
If you were involved in a serious
relationship, that creates a problem.

178
00:11:20,293 --> 00:11:23,490
Rest assured, that relationship
ended two years ago.

179
00:11:23,693 --> 00:11:26,651
Strike "consummated like bunnies"
from the record.

180
00:11:27,573 --> 00:11:30,645
Is there anything in this record
that is actually true?

181
00:11:30,853 --> 00:11:33,845
Well, yes. We got married in Vegas.

182
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:36,812
And the names, I think.

183
00:11:37,373 --> 00:11:41,332
Based on what I've heard, you certainly
don't qualify for an annulment.

184
00:11:42,093 --> 00:11:44,288
If you don't wanna be together,
file for divorce.

185
00:11:44,893 --> 00:11:49,011
That's great. You happy? Look what
you did with your funny, funny form.

186
00:11:49,253 --> 00:11:53,451
What? Me? What about you and your
"consummated like bunnies" nonsense?

187
00:11:53,693 --> 00:11:54,489
And what--

188
00:11:54,693 --> 00:11:59,005
What are you typing that for?
She said we don't get the annulment.

189
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:01,050
Don't type that. What--

190
00:12:01,293 --> 00:12:02,806
Stop typing!

191
00:12:03,813 --> 00:12:05,166
Stop typing!

192
00:12:05,773 --> 00:12:08,207
"Stop typing, stop typing! "

193
00:12:08,813 --> 00:12:12,010
Okay, do you see what you're
keeping me married to?

194
00:12:12,893 --> 00:12:14,451
Get out of my chambers.

195
00:12:14,653 --> 00:12:16,052
Lady, here's the deal.

196
00:12:16,293 --> 00:12:20,172
I came here for an annulment, and
I'm not leaving here until I get one!

197
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:23,604
-Would you like a night in jail?
-Thank you for your time.

198
00:12:46,053 --> 00:12:47,964
That Porsche guy took his car back.

199
00:12:50,973 --> 00:12:53,692
But you found the keys to his clothes?

200
00:12:55,013 --> 00:12:59,291
No, I just love the way it feels
when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.

201
00:12:59,493 --> 00:13:01,848
They'll think you own one
because of the clothes?

202
00:13:02,053 --> 00:13:03,611
Of course.

203
00:13:04,093 --> 00:13:07,403
Only an idiot would wear this stuff
if he didn't have the car.

204
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,204
That is true.

205
00:13:13,413 --> 00:13:16,485
Yeah, but only a genius would
swallow a sonic blaster gun.

206
00:13:16,693 --> 00:13:18,445
Oh, I've been there.

207
00:13:20,693 --> 00:13:23,685
I am gonna go drive my Porsche.

208
00:13:24,093 --> 00:13:26,243
You know you don't actually have one.

209
00:13:26,453 --> 00:13:30,207
What are you doing? I'm in character.
Will you talk to her?

210
00:13:31,973 --> 00:13:34,089
I think it just moved.
It's poking me.

211
00:13:34,293 --> 00:13:36,045
We'll go to the emergency room.

212
00:13:36,253 --> 00:13:39,609
No, you can't leave me here with them.
We're babysitting.

213
00:13:39,813 --> 00:13:42,646
The babies are asleep.
You'll be okay on your own.

214
00:13:42,853 --> 00:13:45,128
You can't leave me with them.
We're a team.

215
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,608
We're playing a zone.
They'll triple-team me!

216
00:13:48,973 --> 00:13:52,170
He's got plastic in his throat.
We gotta go to the hospital.

217
00:13:52,493 --> 00:13:56,247
But a doctor won't be able to help him.
And it's just gonna. . .

218
00:13:56,453 --> 00:13:59,411
. . .naturally pass through
his system in seven years.

219
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,526
-I think that's gum.
-I'm pretty sure it's gun.

220
00:14:05,293 --> 00:14:07,011
This really hurts. Let's go.

221
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:10,444
But no! A real man wouldn't
just run to the hospital.

222
00:14:11,253 --> 00:14:13,608
No! What would Krog do?

223
00:14:15,613 --> 00:14:19,606
Why isn't that valet back
with my Porsche?

224
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:22,924
Maybe because you've got the keys?

225
00:14:28,293 --> 00:14:31,888
-That was totally your fault.
-My fault? You threatened the judge.

226
00:14:32,093 --> 00:14:34,891
You ripped the paper out
of the court reporter's machine!

227
00:14:35,093 --> 00:14:38,210
That was the only way I could
get him to stop typing!

228
00:14:39,053 --> 00:14:40,930
Hi. How are the Gellers?

229
00:14:44,493 --> 00:14:47,610
Don't call us that.

230
00:14:48,253 --> 00:14:52,212
The judge wouldn't let us get an
annulment. Now we gotta get a divorce!

231
00:14:52,773 --> 00:14:55,003
Did a Porsche throw up on you?

232
00:14:59,693 --> 00:15:01,411
It's "Porsche-a" !

233
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:05,213
Me taking care of you
is no problem, huh?

234
00:15:05,413 --> 00:15:08,052
You guys feel safe, right?

235
00:15:08,253 --> 00:15:11,211
I'm gonna take that spit bubble
as a "Yeah, I do! "

236
00:15:11,773 --> 00:15:15,812
Let's get rid of this dirty diaper.
I'll set you up with a clean one.

237
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:20,042
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.
I just have to clean that up.

238
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,813
Because, let's face it,
we're at Monica's.

239
00:15:24,693 --> 00:15:28,845
I broke it. All right.
Well, that's just the way things go.

240
00:15:29,093 --> 00:15:31,209
Okay. Good.

241
00:15:32,693 --> 00:15:34,411
Why are there only two of you?

242
00:15:34,653 --> 00:15:36,052
Where's Leslie?

243
00:15:36,253 --> 00:15:39,768
Well, you can't answer.
Leslie? Where are you, Leslie?

244
00:15:40,093 --> 00:15:42,926
Now would be a good time
for your first words.

245
00:15:45,493 --> 00:15:46,812
Well, look at you!

246
00:15:48,453 --> 00:15:52,241
You are a little bit mischievous.
My gosh!

247
00:15:52,893 --> 00:15:55,123
Oh, you're a lot mischievous.

248
00:15:57,053 --> 00:15:58,805
Well, it'll dry.

249
00:15:59,573 --> 00:16:02,133
You sit with your brother
and sister now. . .

250
00:16:02,373 --> 00:16:04,011
. . .who aren't there.

251
00:16:17,813 --> 00:16:18,723
How do you feel?

252
00:16:18,933 --> 00:16:22,448
Let's just say, Krog will be equipped
to destroy the universe again. . .

253
00:16:22,693 --> 00:16:24,490
. . .in 1 2 to 1 4 hours.

254
00:16:25,973 --> 00:16:28,851
I totally took care of the babies
all by myself.

255
00:16:29,053 --> 00:16:30,884
I fed them, bathed them
and put them to bed.

256
00:16:31,093 --> 00:16:33,607
And protected them from a tornado?

257
00:16:37,453 --> 00:16:38,442
Oh, my God!

258
00:16:38,653 --> 00:16:41,008
I know. The babies are asleep.

259
00:16:41,893 --> 00:16:43,645
Phoebe, what happened here?

260
00:16:43,893 --> 00:16:46,691
I did it. I took care
of the babies all by myself.

261
00:16:46,893 --> 00:16:50,772
-But my apartment!
-Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.

262
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:53,361
But the mess!

263
00:16:53,573 --> 00:16:57,168
Is not as important as the fact
that Phoebe took care of the babies.

264
00:16:58,493 --> 00:17:01,007
You're right. I shouldn't freak out.

265
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:04,370
This is what it'll be like
when we have babies. When's that?

266
00:17:07,853 --> 00:17:09,411
Phoebe, look at this mess!

267
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,490
Honey, thank God you're home.
I was getting worried.

268
00:17:21,973 --> 00:17:24,203
I picked up the divorce papers.

269
00:17:24,973 --> 00:17:29,444
I've already signed everything.
I put little X's where you need to sign.

270
00:17:29,653 --> 00:17:32,247
Little X's. Great!
That makes up for everything.

271
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:37,805
You know, you've done
a lot of stupid stuff too, okay?

272
00:17:38,053 --> 00:17:40,726
Name one stupid thing that is
as stupid as this one.

273
00:17:40,933 --> 00:17:43,401
How about you flew to London
to stop my wedding?

274
00:17:43,613 --> 00:17:46,207
You told me you loved me
after I was married.

275
00:17:46,453 --> 00:17:50,890
Wait, that was different. I did those
things because I was in love with you.

276
00:17:51,093 --> 00:17:52,412
Right.

277
00:17:55,773 --> 00:17:58,651
You're right. That's very different.

278
00:17:58,893 --> 00:18:01,088
So let's just sign the papers.

279
00:18:03,693 --> 00:18:04,648
What?

280
00:18:04,853 --> 00:18:06,002
Nothing.

281
00:18:07,093 --> 00:18:09,288
Okay, can we just sign, please?

282
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:22,645
Congratulations.

283
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:24,809
Okay, wait, Ross. Wait a minute.

284
00:18:26,413 --> 00:18:29,007
I kind of have a little confession.

285
00:18:29,213 --> 00:18:30,532
What?

286
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:33,201
Well, you know,
this whole marriage thing.

287
00:18:33,693 --> 00:18:35,251
Kind of my idea.

288
00:18:36,293 --> 00:18:37,851
Excuse me?

289
00:18:38,053 --> 00:18:42,410
Remember how we were too drunk to
remember anything when we were married?

290
00:18:44,253 --> 00:18:49,008
I didn't really wanna say anything,
but it just kept coming back to me.

291
00:18:49,773 --> 00:18:54,164
We were in the casino, and you thought
it'd be funny to eat a lot of grapes.

292
00:18:55,053 --> 00:18:59,604
And I thought it would be funnier
if we got married.

293
00:18:59,893 --> 00:19:04,091
So, as a compromise, we decided
first to get married and then. . .

294
00:19:04,293 --> 00:19:07,603
. . .to eat a lot of grapes.

295
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:14,730
Sorry I got us into this whole thing.

296
00:19:15,453 --> 00:19:17,728
So then if you think about it. . .

297
00:19:17,973 --> 00:19:20,726
. . .this is all your fault.

298
00:19:22,493 --> 00:19:24,211
Yeah, don't push it, though.

299
00:19:27,213 --> 00:19:28,612
I gotta say. . .

300
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,602
. . .I know I divorce a lot of women.

301
00:19:34,893 --> 00:19:37,487
Never thought I'd be divorcing you.

302
00:19:38,013 --> 00:19:39,207
I know.

303
00:19:39,653 --> 00:19:43,202
I always thought if we got married,
that'd be the one that stuck.

304
00:19:44,013 --> 00:19:46,208
And it wouldn't be a secret. . .

305
00:19:46,693 --> 00:19:49,810
. . .and we wouldn't have our
wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.

306
00:19:51,973 --> 00:19:53,611
Did I even treat?

307
00:19:53,853 --> 00:19:57,402
No, it was on the house.
It was a newlywed special.

308
00:19:58,093 --> 00:20:00,687
That may be the most depressing thing
I've heard.

309
00:20:03,893 --> 00:20:06,202
I should get these
to my lawyer's office.

310
00:20:07,213 --> 00:20:09,249
Thanks for taking care of all this.

311
00:20:09,453 --> 00:20:10,568
No problem.

312
00:20:21,373 --> 00:20:23,762
-I'm gonna need a copy of those.
-Totally.

313
00:20:31,453 --> 00:20:34,013
Careful around my Porsche!

314
00:20:35,853 --> 00:20:36,808
Hi, Joey.

315
00:20:37,053 --> 00:20:39,613
Hey. How you doing?

316
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:42,687
He has the most amazing Porsche
under there.

317
00:20:42,893 --> 00:20:45,851
I'd show you, but I just tucked
her in. She's sleeping.

318
00:20:47,453 --> 00:20:49,444
Would you like to go for a drink?
