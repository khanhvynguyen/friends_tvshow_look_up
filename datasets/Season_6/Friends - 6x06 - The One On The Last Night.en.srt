1
00:00:08,132 --> 00:00:11,761
I'm moving out, so you're
in charge of paying the rent.

2
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:14,091
-When's it due?
-On the first.

3
00:00:14,332 --> 00:00:15,685
And that's every month?

4
00:00:16,372 --> 00:00:18,488
No, just the months
you want to live here.

5
00:00:20,052 --> 00:00:21,929
Okay, here's the phone bill.

6
00:00:23,092 --> 00:00:24,571
Oh, my God!

7
00:00:25,772 --> 00:00:27,524
That's our phone number.

8
00:00:28,932 --> 00:00:32,004
I know I kind of sprung this
me-moving-out-on-you thing.

9
00:00:32,252 --> 00:00:35,642
-Why don't I cover you for a while?
-No way!

10
00:00:35,892 --> 00:00:38,929
Joey Tribbiani does not
take charity. . .

11
00:00:39,612 --> 00:00:40,761
. . .anymore.

12
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:44,364
-It's not charity, Joe.
-Forget it.

13
00:00:44,612 --> 00:00:46,762
Thanks, but I'm done
taking money from you.

14
00:00:46,972 --> 00:00:49,930
I can take care of myself.
What's next? Come on.

15
00:00:50,172 --> 00:00:51,571
Here's the electric bill.

16
00:00:51,812 --> 00:00:55,202
-This is how much we pay for electric?
-Well, yeah.

17
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,611
So we'll do
the rest of the bills later, then?

18
00:01:02,652 --> 00:01:04,370
The One On The Last Night

19

20
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:41,962
Will Joey have to give up
the apartment?

21
00:01:42,212 --> 00:01:44,362
I offered him money,
but he wouldn't take it.

22
00:01:44,612 --> 00:01:45,965
How much does he need?

23
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:48,561
$1 500 would cover him
for a few months. . .

24
00:01:48,772 --> 00:01:52,367
. . .but I have to trick him into
taking it so I don't hurt his pride.

25
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,568
Why don't you hire him as an actor?

26
00:01:55,732 --> 00:01:59,645
You could have him dress up
and put on skits whenever you want.

27
00:02:01,452 --> 00:02:03,966
Well, that would help the pride thing.

28
00:02:06,412 --> 00:02:10,121
Wow, you look great! Do you wanna
move in with me tomorrow?

29
00:02:13,332 --> 00:02:14,811
Any plans for tonight?

30
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:17,407
Instead of being sad on my
last night with Rachel. . .

31
00:02:17,652 --> 00:02:21,440
. . .we're going out to celebrate
Rachel's moving in with Phoebe.

32
00:02:21,692 --> 00:02:24,729
-And also my birthday.
-It's not your birthday.

33
00:02:25,332 --> 00:02:30,008
What a mean thing to say! I'd never
tell you it wasn't your birthday.

34
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:35,650
You guys have anything planned
for the big last night?

35
00:02:35,892 --> 00:02:39,441
Instead of just hanging out,
we figure we'd do nothing.

36
00:02:41,172 --> 00:02:45,370
Knicks' season opener tonight.
I thought you'd come and watch it.

37
00:02:45,612 --> 00:02:46,886
I don't know, Ross.

38
00:02:47,132 --> 00:02:50,841
Not if you talk about how you gave up
basketball to become a paleontologist.

39
00:02:51,092 --> 00:02:55,449
I did give up a career in basketball
to become a paleontologist!

40
00:02:56,212 --> 00:02:58,282
-Pheebs--
-You're not dressed yet?

41
00:02:58,532 --> 00:03:01,171
We're supposed to start having fun
in 1 5 minutes!

42
00:03:02,132 --> 00:03:05,010
And clearly, not a minute sooner.

43
00:03:05,692 --> 00:03:09,207
You are packed, though, right?
Please tell me you're packed?

44
00:03:09,452 --> 00:03:12,489
Of course I'm packed.
Monica, relax.

45
00:03:12,732 --> 00:03:15,007
I wanted to ask Phoebe
what I should wear.

46
00:03:15,252 --> 00:03:17,686
My God, I can't get a minute of peace.

47
00:03:21,292 --> 00:03:23,089
Oh, my God!

48
00:03:25,012 --> 00:03:27,207
Monica's just gonna kill you.

49
00:03:27,452 --> 00:03:28,521
I know.

50
00:03:28,772 --> 00:03:30,763
What you're wearing is fine
for that.

51
00:03:35,052 --> 00:03:36,485
You're not packed!

52
00:03:37,012 --> 00:03:39,367
You're not packed even a little bit!

53
00:03:40,452 --> 00:03:41,680
Surprise!

54
00:03:43,692 --> 00:03:45,808
Don't get mad,
because this is what happened.

55
00:03:46,052 --> 00:03:49,362
I started packing,
then I realized, "What am I doing?"

56
00:03:49,572 --> 00:03:52,211
I am lousy at packing, right?

57
00:03:52,692 --> 00:03:54,091
But you love packing!

58
00:03:54,332 --> 00:03:58,086
So as a gift to you
on our last night. . . .

59
00:04:02,772 --> 00:04:04,410
I'll be coordinator!

60
00:04:04,652 --> 00:04:07,883
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
I didn't get you anything.

61
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:10,766
Everybody has to help.
Phoebe, can you help?

62
00:04:11,012 --> 00:04:12,240
I have plans.

63
00:04:12,772 --> 00:04:15,047
-You have plans with us.
-That's right.

64
00:04:16,612 --> 00:04:19,285
Chandler can make boxes, Ross can
wrap, and Joey can lift.

65
00:04:19,532 --> 00:04:21,568
Tell the guys
they have to help out.

66
00:04:21,812 --> 00:04:23,484
My God, thank you!

67
00:04:24,812 --> 00:04:27,201
Monica's gonna make you pack!
She's got jobs for everyone!

68
00:04:27,452 --> 00:04:30,649
Now, it's too late for me,
but save yourselves!

69
00:04:32,892 --> 00:04:35,964
The movers will be here in 1 1 hours.
Rachel hasn't packed.

70
00:04:36,212 --> 00:04:38,089
Now, everybody has to help.
Chandler--

71
00:04:38,332 --> 00:04:40,129
I have plans with Joey.

72
00:04:40,892 --> 00:04:44,805
-You said you were doing nothing.
-Yes, but for the last time.

73
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,805
Fine. Now, Ross--

74
00:04:48,052 --> 00:04:50,282
-I can't do it.
-Why not?

75
00:04:50,532 --> 00:04:53,888
-Don't you have Ben?
-Because I have Ben!

76
00:04:54,892 --> 00:04:57,360
It's almost past his bedtime.
Where is he?

77
00:04:57,572 --> 00:04:58,925
He's at a dinner party.

78
00:05:01,292 --> 00:05:03,852
He's really coming?
I can see in your apartment.

79
00:05:04,092 --> 00:05:06,162
Of course he is. What?

80
00:05:06,412 --> 00:05:08,880
You think I'd use my son as an excuse?

81
00:05:09,092 --> 00:05:11,322
What kind of father do you think I am?

82
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:13,047
All right. Sorry.

83
00:05:14,212 --> 00:05:16,123
I gotta go make a fake Ben.

84
00:05:20,652 --> 00:05:21,482
Here it is.

85
00:05:21,732 --> 00:05:24,166
Our last pizzas together as roommates.

86
00:05:24,372 --> 00:05:26,681
I wish I knew that.
I ordered Chinese.

87
00:05:26,932 --> 00:05:28,490
Well, that's okay.

88
00:05:28,732 --> 00:05:31,007
In a way it's kind of nice.
You know?

89
00:05:31,252 --> 00:05:35,040
Our last dinner together. Me,
bringing the food of my ancestors. . .

90
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:37,362
. . .you, the food of yours!

91
00:05:41,932 --> 00:05:44,446
I had an idea for what to do
on our last night.

92
00:05:44,692 --> 00:05:47,490
What do you say we play a little
foosball for money?

93
00:05:47,732 --> 00:05:51,566
Are you crazy? You haven't beaten me
since my injury-plagued '97 season.

94
00:05:51,812 --> 00:05:55,327
-It'd be easier to give me your money.
-Yes, it would.

95
00:05:56,892 --> 00:05:58,325
What do you say to $50?

96
00:05:58,572 --> 00:06:00,563
-You're on.
-Okay, let's play.

97
00:06:00,772 --> 00:06:02,603
The big game. Italy versus. . .

98
00:06:02,852 --> 00:06:04,285
. . .China, apparently.

99
00:06:08,172 --> 00:06:10,288
Look, it's the Rollerblades.

100
00:06:10,532 --> 00:06:11,965
Oh, God!

101
00:06:12,492 --> 00:06:15,165
You remember when we got these?

102
00:06:18,172 --> 00:06:19,685
I guess you weren't there.

103
00:06:21,372 --> 00:06:24,091
You guys,
we said we were gonna have fun.

104
00:06:24,332 --> 00:06:27,005
Come on. Hey, remember the time. . . .

105
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:33,491
You don't remember?

106
00:06:34,532 --> 00:06:37,808
Sorry, Pheebs. I'm just really sad
that I'm leaving.

107
00:06:38,052 --> 00:06:39,804
I'm gonna miss you so much.

108
00:06:40,052 --> 00:06:43,169
This doesn't have to be so sad,
though, you know?

109
00:06:43,372 --> 00:06:46,364
Instead of thinking about
how you'll miss each other. . .

110
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:50,167
. . .you should think of the things
you're not gonna miss.

111
00:06:51,092 --> 00:06:52,764
I don't think there's anything.

112
00:06:52,972 --> 00:06:55,122
Come on, there's gotta be something.

113
00:06:56,412 --> 00:06:58,130
She's perfect.

114
00:07:01,252 --> 00:07:02,446
I have one.

115
00:07:04,372 --> 00:07:05,885
Okay, you can go first.

116
00:07:06,132 --> 00:07:08,282
I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact. . .

117
00:07:08,532 --> 00:07:12,411
. . .that you're never allowed
to move the phone pen.

118
00:07:15,932 --> 00:07:18,366
That's a good one.
Okay, Monica, anything?

119
00:07:18,612 --> 00:07:20,762
You know,
does Rachel move the phone pen?

120
00:07:21,972 --> 00:07:23,451
Sometimes.

121
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:25,971
Always, actually.

122
00:07:27,812 --> 00:07:30,007
There you go.
Doesn't everyone feel better?

123
00:07:31,572 --> 00:07:33,369
Not just the phone pen.

124
00:07:34,972 --> 00:07:36,530
I never get my messages.

125
00:07:36,772 --> 00:07:38,285
You get your messages.

126
00:07:38,532 --> 00:07:41,569
It doesn't count if you have to
read them off your hand. . .

127
00:07:41,772 --> 00:07:44,491
. . .after you've fallen asleep
on the couch.

128
00:07:44,732 --> 00:07:47,200
So you missed a message from who?
Chandler?

129
00:07:47,452 --> 00:07:48,805
Or your mom?

130
00:07:49,532 --> 00:07:50,885
Or Chandler?

131
00:07:51,092 --> 00:07:52,207
Or your mom?

132
00:07:56,092 --> 00:07:57,810
It worked! No one's sad!

133
00:08:01,972 --> 00:08:02,768
I win again!

134
00:08:03,012 --> 00:08:05,810
That's, like, 500 bucks
you owe me!

135
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:08,282
Man! Five hundred dollars.

136
00:08:08,532 --> 00:08:11,649
That is a lot of electricity, huh?

137
00:08:12,572 --> 00:08:14,210
I gotta buy some food.

138
00:08:15,052 --> 00:08:17,805
Give me a chance to win my money back.
Sudden death. . .

139
00:08:18,052 --> 00:08:20,646
. . .one goal, $1 000.

140
00:08:21,212 --> 00:08:22,645
-You serious?
-Yes!

141
00:08:24,372 --> 00:08:26,044
Get ready to owe me.

142
00:08:26,292 --> 00:08:27,566
Here we go. Ready?

143
00:08:53,252 --> 00:08:54,048
No. . .

144
00:08:54,252 --> 00:08:55,526
. . .one can beat me!

145
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:03,647
That's why only the little fake men
are supposed to do the kicking.

146
00:09:09,612 --> 00:09:12,365
Hi, Ross.
See, other people call me!

147
00:09:12,612 --> 00:09:15,172
Your brother. Score!

148
00:09:16,612 --> 00:09:17,886
What's up?

149
00:09:18,132 --> 00:09:19,281
I'm here with Ben.

150
00:09:19,532 --> 00:09:21,045
Thought we'd say hi.

151
00:09:21,292 --> 00:09:22,088
Put him on.

152
00:09:22,332 --> 00:09:24,687
Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica.

153
00:09:26,492 --> 00:09:29,962
I guess he doesn't feel like
talking right now.

154
00:09:30,172 --> 00:09:32,527
He's smiling, though.

155
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:35,561
Okay, talk to you later.

156
00:09:42,172 --> 00:09:44,606
I think it was better
when you guys were sad.

157
00:09:45,892 --> 00:09:48,167
Hey, remember the Rollerblades?

158
00:09:49,932 --> 00:09:52,241
You know what else I won't miss?
"I'm Monica.

159
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:55,768
I wash the toilets 1 7 times a day,
even if people are on it! "

160
00:09:56,972 --> 00:09:59,566
"Hi, I'm Rachel.
Is my sweater too tight?

161
00:09:59,812 --> 00:10:02,121
I'd better wash it and shrink it! "

162
00:10:02,972 --> 00:10:06,362
"I'm Monica. I never get messages
from interesting people. "

163
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:07,448
I call her.

164
00:10:09,172 --> 00:10:14,087
"Oh, my God! I love Ross. I hate
Ross. I love Ross. I hate Ross! "

165
00:10:15,332 --> 00:10:17,050
"My God!
I can't find a boyfriend.

166
00:10:17,292 --> 00:10:21,285
I'll stumble across the hall and sleep
with the first guy I find there! "

167
00:10:26,772 --> 00:10:30,765
We should get a move on if we want
to make those dinner reservations.

168
00:10:38,172 --> 00:10:39,685
Still broken?

169
00:10:40,332 --> 00:10:41,845
It sucks, man.

170
00:10:42,092 --> 00:10:44,765
Your last night, and I lose the two
most important things:

171
00:10:44,972 --> 00:10:47,042
The foosball table. . .

172
00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:49,010
. . .and $500.

173
00:10:50,172 --> 00:10:53,767
There are other ways to win back
your money. How about blackjack?

174
00:10:54,012 --> 00:10:55,240
Not my game.

175
00:10:55,492 --> 00:10:57,926
You know what?
We can play a new game.

176
00:10:58,172 --> 00:11:00,367
-It's fun!
-What's it called?

177
00:11:01,772 --> 00:11:03,125
Cups.

178
00:11:04,612 --> 00:11:07,922
-I don't know how.
-I'll teach you. It's easy and fun.

179
00:11:08,132 --> 00:11:09,929
-All right.
-Here you go.

180
00:11:11,412 --> 00:11:13,243
I have two queens.
What do you have?

181
00:11:13,732 --> 00:11:15,882
-A 2 and a 5.
-You win! Fifty dollars!

182
00:11:18,692 --> 00:11:20,410
-Really?
-Let's play again.

183
00:11:24,052 --> 00:11:26,202
-What have you got?
-4 and a 9.

184
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:28,245
You're kidding, right?

185
00:11:29,452 --> 00:11:31,761
-No. Why?
-That's a full cup!

186
00:11:33,732 --> 00:11:35,768
Damn, I am good at Cups!

187
00:11:38,092 --> 00:11:39,571
I'm not talking to her.

188
00:11:39,812 --> 00:11:42,201
You have to take the first step. . .

189
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:45,762
. . .because she's the one who's
leaving. It's harder for her.

190
00:11:47,092 --> 00:11:48,207
Maybe you're right.

191
00:11:48,452 --> 00:11:50,761
But she made fun of my phone pen!

192
00:11:51,572 --> 00:11:53,608
I know. I took it hard too.

193
00:11:57,212 --> 00:11:59,442
I feel bad about what happened--

194
00:11:59,692 --> 00:12:02,047
-What are you doing?
-I'm unpacking.

195
00:12:03,412 --> 00:12:05,972
I'm not moving.
Is that picture straight?

196
00:12:06,212 --> 00:12:08,885
It needs to go about 20 blocks
to the left.

197
00:12:09,132 --> 00:12:12,920
You're the one who wants this
big change and move in with Chandler!

198
00:12:13,172 --> 00:12:15,083
You should go!
Why do I have to leave?

199
00:12:15,332 --> 00:12:18,881
-It's my apartment!
-It's mine too! What else you got?

200
00:12:20,092 --> 00:12:21,650
How about: You're moving!

201
00:12:32,012 --> 00:12:33,331
This is ridiculous.

202
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,884
We should be packing you!

203
00:12:38,652 --> 00:12:41,564
-Hey, how you guys doing?
-Great. Monica's moving.

204
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,047
I am not!

205
00:12:44,292 --> 00:12:47,170
Really? How come all your
stuff is in this box?

206
00:12:47,412 --> 00:12:50,848
Okay, you guys,
I think I know what's going on here!

207
00:12:51,372 --> 00:12:53,203
You guys? Stop!

208
00:12:53,972 --> 00:12:58,363
I know you're acting mad because
it'll make it easier to leave.

209
00:12:58,572 --> 00:13:01,564
But deep down, you're really sad.
Deep, deep down.

210
00:13:01,772 --> 00:13:03,842
-No, Phoebe, I am mad!
-Well, deep down!

211
00:13:04,092 --> 00:13:05,241
I'm just mad.

212
00:13:06,212 --> 00:13:07,281
Then keep running.

213
00:13:10,772 --> 00:13:11,602
You win!

214
00:13:11,852 --> 00:13:13,808
-What did you have?
-Nothing beats. . .

215
00:13:14,372 --> 00:13:16,203
. . .a three and a six.

216
00:13:16,932 --> 00:13:18,968
That, my friend, is "D Cup. "

217
00:13:21,052 --> 00:13:23,327
How much have you won so far?

218
00:13:24,732 --> 00:13:26,848
-700.
-Not 700 exactly?

219
00:13:28,532 --> 00:13:29,362
Double it.

220
00:13:31,132 --> 00:13:34,647
In Cups, once you get $700,
you have to double it.

221
00:13:36,332 --> 00:13:38,209
I didn't make up the rules.

222
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:44,006
Now, after you receive the doubling
bonus, you get one card.

223
00:13:44,252 --> 00:13:48,689
That one card could be worth $1 00,
which brings your total to $1 500.

224
00:13:50,132 --> 00:13:54,364
Don't get excited, that won't happen
unless you get the-- No way!

225
00:13:57,332 --> 00:13:59,368
This is the last box of your clothes.

226
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:02,405
I'm just gonna label it
"What were you thinking?"

227
00:14:03,812 --> 00:14:07,248
I was just gonna go across
the hall and write that on Chandler.

228
00:14:09,812 --> 00:14:12,451
Guys, I don't wanna make
things worse, but. . .

229
00:14:12,692 --> 00:14:14,922
. . .I don't wanna live with
Rachel anymore.

230
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,569
You're so mean to each other.

231
00:14:17,772 --> 00:14:20,889
I don't wanna end up like that
with Rachel. I still like you.

232
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:24,206
That's fine because I'm not moving.

233
00:14:25,492 --> 00:14:27,164
Phoebe, you gotta take her.

234
00:14:27,892 --> 00:14:29,450
I said some bad stuff. . .

235
00:14:29,692 --> 00:14:32,650
. . .but Rachel has qualities
that make her a good roommate.

236
00:14:32,892 --> 00:14:34,245
Like what, Monica?

237
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:39,567
She has 1 47,000 pair of boots?

238
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,370
Good start, Mon.

239
00:14:42,452 --> 00:14:44,010
She lets you borrow them.

240
00:14:44,452 --> 00:14:47,205
And you stretch them out
with your big old clown feet.

241
00:14:48,772 --> 00:14:51,411
Do you wanna live outside?
Because it's getting cold!

242
00:14:53,212 --> 00:14:57,888
She gets tons of catalogs and folds
down the pages of things I'd like.

243
00:14:58,292 --> 00:14:59,281
What else?

244
00:15:00,892 --> 00:15:02,610
When I take a shower. . .

245
00:15:03,052 --> 00:15:05,008
. . .she leaves me notes on the mirror.

246
00:15:05,252 --> 00:15:07,368
I do. I do do that.

247
00:15:07,732 --> 00:15:11,407
That's nice. I like having things
to read in the bathroom.

248
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:15,967
When I fall asleep on the couch. . .

249
00:15:17,252 --> 00:15:19,004
. . .she covers me with a blanket.

250
00:15:19,412 --> 00:15:22,927
Well, you know,
I don't want you to be cold.

251
00:15:26,252 --> 00:15:29,767
And when I told her I was gonna
move in with Chandler. . .

252
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,730
. . .she was really supportive.

253
00:15:34,412 --> 00:15:36,004
You were so great.

254
00:15:37,332 --> 00:15:39,527
You made it so easy.

255
00:15:41,332 --> 00:15:43,482
And now you have to leave.

256
00:15:44,012 --> 00:15:46,321
And I have to live with a boy!

257
00:15:49,252 --> 00:15:51,208
It's gonna be fine.

258
00:15:52,212 --> 00:15:54,646
Now I can't wait to live with you!

259
00:15:55,492 --> 00:15:56,561
You know what we should do?

260
00:15:56,812 --> 00:16:00,600
Bring Monica, and we'll live together!
We'll have so much fun!

261
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,288
I think she's moving in with Chandler.

262
00:16:04,532 --> 00:16:07,524
Oh, that's right.
You're still set on that?

263
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:10,565
Kinda.

264
00:16:16,372 --> 00:16:17,521
Oh, my God!

265
00:16:22,852 --> 00:16:24,683
How's the packing going?

266
00:16:25,212 --> 00:16:28,602
Ben? He's fine. He's right--
Oh, my God!

267
00:16:30,052 --> 00:16:33,169
Get your head out of your shirt
there, son!

268
00:16:35,052 --> 00:16:37,930
Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack.

269
00:16:42,212 --> 00:16:44,567
-What's wrong?
-Ross and I were helping pack. . .

270
00:16:44,772 --> 00:16:48,481
. . .took a little break.
I lost $1 500 to him in Cups!

271
00:16:50,692 --> 00:16:52,648
How did you lose at Cups?

272
00:16:53,172 --> 00:16:54,446
The same way you lost!

273
00:16:54,692 --> 00:16:58,970
I started out with the king and the
queen. Bam! Ross gets a 2 and a 3.

274
00:16:59,572 --> 00:17:02,769
Then I get a jack and a king.
Boom! Ross gets a 4 and 5.

275
00:17:03,332 --> 00:17:06,005
Even Ross was getting the Cup card,
the D Cup. . .

276
00:17:06,252 --> 00:17:11,167
. . .the sitting-down bonus. I didn't
even get half a cup! Nothing!

277
00:17:11,972 --> 00:17:13,041
Oh, man!

278
00:17:13,812 --> 00:17:15,723
He never played before either.

279
00:17:15,972 --> 00:17:19,123
I think beginner's luck
is very important in Cups!

280
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,442
Let's play one more hand.
One more hand.

281
00:17:22,692 --> 00:17:26,048
No more! I cannot lose another dime.
I'm serious this time.

282
00:17:26,292 --> 00:17:27,691
In fact, look.

283
00:17:27,932 --> 00:17:29,650
I wanna give you something.

284
00:17:29,892 --> 00:17:32,531
Let me give it to you before
I pawn it for Cups money.

285
00:17:36,172 --> 00:17:39,164
I want you to have
the big, white dog. . .

286
00:17:39,412 --> 00:17:43,007
. . .as a thank-you for being
such a great roommate.

287
00:17:43,212 --> 00:17:46,409
I can't take the big, white dog.
You love it.

288
00:17:46,652 --> 00:17:49,007
It's "him. " Not "it. "

289
00:17:49,892 --> 00:17:52,360
What if I bought it from you?

290
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:55,689
Then your nice gesture would be
giving it to me at a reasonable price.

291
00:17:55,932 --> 00:17:57,524
Say $1 500?

292
00:17:59,332 --> 00:18:02,688
Wait a second.
I see what you're trying to do here.

293
00:18:03,092 --> 00:18:05,162
You're trying to give me money again!

294
00:18:05,372 --> 00:18:07,203
When did I try to give you money?

295
00:18:07,452 --> 00:18:09,170
Over there with the bills!

296
00:18:09,372 --> 00:18:12,250
You tried to give me charity,
I said no, you dropped it.

297
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:14,244
We had a nice last night together.

298
00:18:14,492 --> 00:18:17,882
We had some fun, we gambled, nobody
tried to give anybody any money.

299
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,651
Now you start with the
charity thing again!

300
00:18:22,892 --> 00:18:26,487
I'm trying to help you out.
I wanna make sure that you're okay.

301
00:18:26,732 --> 00:18:28,688
I will be okay.

302
00:18:28,932 --> 00:18:32,686
You gotta get it out of your head
that I can't take care of myself.

303
00:18:33,932 --> 00:18:36,890
I'm not gonna miss you helping me
out with money.

304
00:18:37,132 --> 00:18:39,327
The only thing I'm gonna miss. . .

305
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,251
. . .is you.

306
00:18:43,892 --> 00:18:45,291
And now the dog.

307
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:56,168
-Call me when you get there, okay?
-Okay.

308
00:18:56,412 --> 00:18:58,004
I'm really gonna miss you.

309
00:19:04,972 --> 00:19:06,724
I have your key.

310
00:19:07,652 --> 00:19:09,688
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

311
00:19:15,292 --> 00:19:19,126
God, this is silly.
I'll see you in a couple of hours.

312
00:19:20,732 --> 00:19:22,006
Bye, house.

313
00:19:53,012 --> 00:19:55,480
-She really left.
-I know.

314
00:19:58,252 --> 00:20:01,210
-Thank you.
-No problem, roomie.

315
00:20:08,972 --> 00:20:11,281
-Can I ask you a question?
-Sure.

316
00:20:11,532 --> 00:20:14,126
What the hell is that dog doing here?

317
00:20:18,852 --> 00:20:22,003
I invented the game of Cups
as a way to give Joey money.

318
00:20:22,252 --> 00:20:25,562
-And now you want that money back?
-Exactly.

319
00:20:25,812 --> 00:20:28,007
What kind of idiot do you
take me for?

320
00:20:29,212 --> 00:20:31,203
It's not a real game.
I made it up.

321
00:20:31,452 --> 00:20:34,410
I'm sorry you lost your money.
But I won it fair and square.

322
00:20:34,652 --> 00:20:35,971
At a fake game!

323
00:20:36,932 --> 00:20:39,492
If you wanna try to
make some of it back. . .

324
00:20:39,732 --> 00:20:42,769
. . .I'd be glad to play you for it.
But I should warn you.

325
00:20:42,972 --> 00:20:46,044
I am very good at Cups.

326
00:20:47,692 --> 00:20:50,684
I assume the saucer card
came up when you played last?

327
00:20:52,932 --> 00:20:55,366
Let's see if it comes up this time.
