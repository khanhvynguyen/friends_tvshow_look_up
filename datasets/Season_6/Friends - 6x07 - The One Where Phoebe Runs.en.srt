1
00:00:02,812 --> 00:00:04,040
Ready?

2
00:00:04,812 --> 00:00:07,610
Hi, it's Rachel and Phoebe's.
Please. . .

3
00:00:07,812 --> 00:00:09,404
-. . .Ieave--
-Leave.

4
00:00:10,972 --> 00:00:12,246
But I just said "Ieave. "

5
00:00:12,492 --> 00:00:15,245
I know because you have
all the good words.

6
00:00:15,612 --> 00:00:19,969
What do I get? I get "it's," "and. "
Oh, I'm sorry, I have "a. " Forget it.

7
00:00:20,692 --> 00:00:23,126
-That's silly.
-All right. So let's switch.

8
00:00:23,372 --> 00:00:25,442
No, I have all the good words.

9
00:00:25,932 --> 00:00:27,923
Okay, fine, fine.
We can switch.

10
00:00:30,612 --> 00:00:31,886
- Hi. . .
-. . .everybody. . .

11
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:33,042
-. . .it's. . .
-. . .Rachel. . .

12
00:00:33,292 --> 00:00:34,168
-. . .and. . .
-. . .Phoebe's.

13
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:36,448
Wait. How did you do that?

14
00:00:36,692 --> 00:00:38,045
What?

15
00:00:38,892 --> 00:00:41,611
Oh, you're no ordinary roommate,
are you?

16
00:00:42,652 --> 00:00:46,167
Can we finish this later?
I'm going running before it gets dark.

17
00:00:46,612 --> 00:00:48,762
-Why don't you come with me?
-Really?

18
00:00:49,012 --> 00:00:53,528
It'll be fun! We'll run in the park.
It'll be our roommate-bonding thing.

19
00:00:53,732 --> 00:00:55,131
Okay, let's go running!

20
00:00:55,372 --> 00:00:57,681
-There's cute guys there.
-Let's run towards them!

21
00:00:59,452 --> 00:01:01,170
Wait just one more second.

22
00:01:01,412 --> 00:01:04,051
Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's.
Please leave a message. Thanks!

23
00:01:04,812 --> 00:01:07,007
Wait a minute.
You took all the words!

24
00:01:07,212 --> 00:01:09,726
You've met your match, Rachel Greene!

25
00:01:11,492 --> 00:01:13,323
The One Where Phoebe Runs

27
00:01:49,292 --> 00:01:51,965
I just finished this
fascinating book.

28
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:55,249
By the year 2030,
there'll be computers. . .

29
00:01:55,452 --> 00:02:00,287
. . .that can carry out the same amount
of functions as a human brain.

30
00:02:00,532 --> 00:02:02,523
So, theoretically,
you could download. . .

31
00:02:02,772 --> 00:02:06,048
. . .your thoughts and memories
into this computer. . .

32
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:10,285
. . .and live forever as a machine.

33
00:02:14,332 --> 00:02:18,007
And I just realized I can sleep
with my eyes open.

34
00:02:21,932 --> 00:02:25,561
Honey, it was a great idea,
nailing the boxes to the floor.

35
00:02:27,652 --> 00:02:30,849
-I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
-So you can move them!

36
00:02:32,332 --> 00:02:35,881
And while I'm doing that, Ross has
a great computer story for you.

37
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,881
Hey, everybody!
I'd like you to meet Janine.

38
00:02:41,132 --> 00:02:43,009
She's gonna be my new roommate!

39
00:02:47,172 --> 00:02:49,083
And she's gonna live with me!

40
00:02:50,932 --> 00:02:52,684
It's nice to meet you. Janine. . .?

41
00:02:52,932 --> 00:02:54,081
Le Croix.

42
00:02:54,332 --> 00:02:56,971
I didn't know that.
What a pretty last name.

43
00:02:58,412 --> 00:02:59,731
So where are you from?

44
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:01,849
Australia.
I just moved here.

45
00:03:02,052 --> 00:03:03,451
From the land down under?

46
00:03:03,652 --> 00:03:05,643
I didn't know that either!

47
00:03:06,892 --> 00:03:08,371
So what do you do?

48
00:03:08,612 --> 00:03:11,285
-I'm a dancer.
-You're a dancer?

49
00:03:11,612 --> 00:03:13,409
She's a dancer!

50
00:03:15,572 --> 00:03:17,847
I think I'll go unpack.

51
00:03:28,652 --> 00:03:31,246
Did you interview her
before you asked her to move in?

52
00:03:31,492 --> 00:03:32,368
Of course!

53
00:03:33,132 --> 00:03:34,565
What did you ask her?

54
00:03:34,812 --> 00:03:36,450
When can you move in?

55
00:03:38,932 --> 00:03:41,685
Thank you for bringing her
into our lives.

56
00:03:42,452 --> 00:03:44,488
Unbelievable.

57
00:03:45,172 --> 00:03:46,651
You like her too?

58
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,570
Look at all the boxes!

59
00:03:50,332 --> 00:03:52,482
I cannot wait to ask her out.

60
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,883
Wait a minute.
You can't. She's your roommate.

61
00:03:56,132 --> 00:03:57,451
It'll be too complicated.

62
00:03:57,692 --> 00:03:59,091
Yeah, don't do it.

63
00:03:59,332 --> 00:04:02,483
I mean, if you date her,
then I can't date her.

64
00:04:03,532 --> 00:04:06,842
Think about it. Remember
when you broke up with Donna. . .

65
00:04:07,092 --> 00:04:10,243
. . .how horrible it was when you
bumped into her at the supermarket?

66
00:04:10,492 --> 00:04:11,845
Oh, God, yeah.

67
00:04:12,092 --> 00:04:14,560
Now imagine you live
at the supermarket.

68
00:04:14,812 --> 00:04:15,927
Okay!

69
00:04:19,012 --> 00:04:22,163
You're right! I don't want that.
I can't date her.

70
00:04:22,412 --> 00:04:26,291
You'd better watch the flirting too,
because it could be trouble.

71
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:28,250
Well, that's gonna be tough, Mon.

72
00:04:28,492 --> 00:04:31,723
It's hard for me to be around
an attractive woman and not flirt.

73
00:04:32,732 --> 00:04:35,644
You're around me all the time,
and you don't flirt.

74
00:04:36,492 --> 00:04:38,801
A little sad about that, sweetie?

75
00:04:44,132 --> 00:04:47,249
I have to tie my shoes, so you
go ahead. I'll catch up.

76
00:04:51,732 --> 00:04:54,929
Come on, that's not running!
Let's go!

77
00:05:00,572 --> 00:05:02,642
I'm telling you, when she runs. . .

78
00:05:02,892 --> 00:05:04,883
. . .she looks like Kermit the Frog. . .

79
00:05:05,132 --> 00:05:07,043
. . .and the Six Million Dollar Man.

80
00:05:08,292 --> 00:05:11,602
Monica had such a crush on him.

81
00:05:11,852 --> 00:05:16,130
She used to kiss his poster
every night before she went to bed.

82
00:05:16,372 --> 00:05:17,487
I used to do that too!

83
00:05:17,732 --> 00:05:20,929
Did you also have his album,
"It's Not Easy Being Green"?

84
00:05:22,732 --> 00:05:24,529
Oh, Mon.

85
00:05:26,652 --> 00:05:28,324
So Phoebe runs weird, huh?

86
00:05:28,932 --> 00:05:31,492
Yeah. And I know she'll
want to run again.

87
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:34,485
I don't know how to get out of it.
I mean, I live with her.

88
00:05:34,812 --> 00:05:37,690
Why don't you be straight with her?
Tell her the truth.

89
00:05:37,932 --> 00:05:41,242
You're right.
I should just tell her the truth.

90
00:05:42,452 --> 00:05:46,445
Pheebs, Monica tripped me. I don't
think I can ever run again, ever!

91
00:05:47,932 --> 00:05:50,002
Why? Why would you do that?

92
00:05:50,452 --> 00:05:51,362
I don't know.

93
00:05:53,012 --> 00:05:55,082
Rachel, I'm sorry I hurt your ankles.

94
00:05:55,452 --> 00:05:56,248
Ankle.

95
00:05:56,452 --> 00:05:57,680
We'll see.

96
00:06:02,172 --> 00:06:04,288
Okay. I am officially unpacked.

97
00:06:04,532 --> 00:06:06,170
Thanks for helping me, man.

98
00:06:07,052 --> 00:06:08,007
Joe?

99
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,482
Well, I guess Joey went home.

100
00:06:17,412 --> 00:06:20,961
And look, there is still one box
I have to unpack.

101
00:06:24,292 --> 00:06:25,520
I got you!

102
00:06:27,212 --> 00:06:28,042
Oh, my God. . .

103
00:06:28,252 --> 00:06:30,288
. . .you almost gave me
a heart attack.

104
00:06:31,092 --> 00:06:33,401
It was so hard not to laugh.

105
00:06:34,292 --> 00:06:36,248
Hey, the place looks great.

106
00:06:36,492 --> 00:06:37,561
Not bad, right?

107
00:06:37,812 --> 00:06:41,441
Monica's working late,
so I'm gonna make this place spotless.

108
00:06:42,052 --> 00:06:43,280
You know what else I'll do?

109
00:06:43,532 --> 00:06:46,285
I'm gonna go downstairs
and get her some flowers.

110
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:48,284
Who wouldn't want to live with me?

111
00:06:48,732 --> 00:06:49,801
I don't.

112
00:06:50,492 --> 00:06:54,041
No, I want to live with
the super-hot Australian dancer!

113
00:06:54,292 --> 00:06:57,090
How's that going? Are you okay
with the not-flirting thing?

114
00:06:57,332 --> 00:06:59,084
So far. But it's tough.

115
00:06:59,332 --> 00:07:03,245
I've got this built-up flirting energy,
and I don't know how to get rid of it.

116
00:07:05,932 --> 00:07:07,809
How you doing?

117
00:07:12,492 --> 00:07:14,050
Oh, man!

118
00:07:15,452 --> 00:07:17,682
Sorry. There's just
more room out here.

119
00:07:17,932 --> 00:07:22,847
No, you just reminded me
that I have to do my stretches too.

120
00:07:28,892 --> 00:07:30,371
Why don't you try to be. . .?

121
00:07:31,612 --> 00:07:32,965
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

122
00:07:33,212 --> 00:07:34,884
I didn't want you to touch me. . .

123
00:07:35,132 --> 00:07:38,090
. . .because I'm all sweaty
from the workout.

124
00:07:38,572 --> 00:07:39,891
I'm gonna hit the shower.

125
00:07:42,932 --> 00:07:44,411
Oh, my God!

126
00:07:44,652 --> 00:07:46,483
Sorry about that stuff
hanging in there.

127
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:49,451
It's just my thongs are
too delicate for the dryer.

128
00:08:02,052 --> 00:08:03,531
Oh, yeah, it's me.

129
00:08:03,772 --> 00:08:06,730
I saw you grab your running shoes
this morning and sneak out.

130
00:08:07,052 --> 00:08:09,088
You lied so you could run by yourself.

131
00:08:09,332 --> 00:08:11,288
No, Phoebe, no. I was. . . .

132
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,090
I was actually just checking. . .

133
00:08:13,332 --> 00:08:14,367
. . .to see. . .

134
00:08:14,612 --> 00:08:16,250
. . .if I could run. And I can!

135
00:08:16,492 --> 00:08:17,891
Please, I'm not an idiot.

136
00:08:18,132 --> 00:08:19,360
No, wait. Phoebe?

137
00:08:31,532 --> 00:08:34,365
Wow. Couples who live together
do start to look alike.

138
00:08:36,132 --> 00:08:37,929
So, Mondler. . . .

139
00:08:40,652 --> 00:08:43,246
What are you doing?

140
00:08:43,492 --> 00:08:45,562
What does it look like?
I am cleaning.

141
00:08:45,812 --> 00:08:48,963
Did you get Monica's authorization
to move all her stuff?

142
00:08:49,292 --> 00:08:51,647
I don't need that.
I'll put everything back.

143
00:08:51,892 --> 00:08:54,042
Put it back exactly
where you found it?

144
00:08:54,252 --> 00:08:57,324
Yes. I'm gonna put it back
exactly where I found it.

145
00:08:57,652 --> 00:09:00,041
First of all,
that attitude is not helping.

146
00:09:00,292 --> 00:09:03,443
She won't care if I put her stuff
back in the same stupid place.

147
00:09:03,652 --> 00:09:07,042
Hello? Did you just meet Monica?

148
00:09:08,052 --> 00:09:10,885
She'll recognize
that I did a nice thing. . .

149
00:09:11,132 --> 00:09:12,724
. . .and appreciate it.

150
00:09:13,372 --> 00:09:15,328
Actually, this will work out well.

151
00:09:15,532 --> 00:09:17,363
Because when you move back
with Joey. . .

152
00:09:17,612 --> 00:09:20,445
. . .Joey's hot new roommate
can come live with me.

153
00:09:21,052 --> 00:09:23,441
Oh, I see. You're trying
to freak me out.

154
00:09:23,692 --> 00:09:28,129
Chandler, Monica is really weird
about this kind of stuff, all right?

155
00:09:28,372 --> 00:09:32,843
Believe me, I lived with her for
1 6 years. She's going to freak out.

156
00:09:33,052 --> 00:09:35,441
Oh, my God.
She's going to sit on you.

157
00:09:36,452 --> 00:09:38,568
No, she is not.
I'll prove it to you.

158
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,450
I'll call her right now.

159
00:09:41,732 --> 00:09:43,051
Phone's done.

160
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,049
-Hey, Mon. How's it going?
-Terrible.

161
00:09:48,292 --> 00:09:50,442
If I want something done right,
I have to do it myself.

162
00:09:50,692 --> 00:09:52,284
Other people just wreck stuff.

163
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,247
I think I might kill someone tonight.

164
00:09:58,452 --> 00:10:00,647
Come on, it can't be that bad.

165
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,484
The only thing getting me through. . .

166
00:10:02,732 --> 00:10:04,529
. . .is knowing I'll see you soon.

167
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:07,889
I might even try
to get out of here early.

168
00:10:08,132 --> 00:10:09,850
It sounds like they need you there.

169
00:10:10,092 --> 00:10:13,482
-You're just hanging out with Ross?
-It's all good! Okay, bye!

170
00:10:15,292 --> 00:10:16,645
She's gonna kill me.

171
00:10:17,212 --> 00:10:19,487
The phone was facing the other way.

172
00:10:20,292 --> 00:10:22,522
And that goes back up there.

173
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,483
We should start with the big stuff.

174
00:10:28,732 --> 00:10:32,042
That'll be the easiest.
Let's start with the couch.

175
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:34,567
I got it.

176
00:10:38,332 --> 00:10:40,129
That doesn't look right.

177
00:10:40,372 --> 00:10:43,364
What are you talking about?
The couch is in line with the carpet.

178
00:10:43,612 --> 00:10:47,730
Then I can just walk over here
and casually put my feet up on. . . .

179
00:10:49,012 --> 00:10:50,570
Okay, here's what we do.

180
00:10:50,812 --> 00:10:53,087
We move the couch
closer to the coffee table.

181
00:10:53,332 --> 00:10:56,165
But then the back of the couch
won't line up with the carpet.

182
00:10:56,412 --> 00:10:59,370
Well, we'll just move
the coffee table. . .

183
00:10:59,612 --> 00:11:00,567
. . .closer to the couch.

184
00:11:00,812 --> 00:11:05,727
But then the coffee table
won't be centered in the seating area.

185
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:09,330
But the coffee table doesn't
match the table!

186
00:11:12,932 --> 00:11:14,650
Look, what am I gonna do?

187
00:11:14,892 --> 00:11:19,204
I'm not flirting, but I'm drawing
her to me like a moth to a flame!

188
00:11:24,292 --> 00:11:26,647
What the hell's going on over here?

189
00:11:28,212 --> 00:11:29,531
Monica's gonna kill you!

190
00:11:31,172 --> 00:11:32,287
I need your help.

191
00:11:32,532 --> 00:11:35,968
I have to do something
to repel this woman.

192
00:11:36,212 --> 00:11:37,964
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

193
00:11:38,212 --> 00:11:39,930
You guys repel women all the time!

194
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,960
Hey, I've been married three times.

195
00:11:49,812 --> 00:11:50,847
No, I've seen it happen.

196
00:11:51,092 --> 00:11:54,721
You get a rapport going with a woman,
but somehow you manage to kill it.

197
00:11:56,012 --> 00:11:57,206
What's your secret?

198
00:11:58,732 --> 00:12:00,848
We do not repel women, okay?

199
00:12:01,052 --> 00:12:02,690
That is completely untrue.

200
00:12:02,932 --> 00:12:05,366
Oh, yes, we do, my man.

201
00:12:06,052 --> 00:12:08,247
Remember when we went to a dance. . .

202
00:12:08,492 --> 00:12:11,450
. . .and you walked up to that girl
you liked and talked. . .

203
00:12:11,692 --> 00:12:14,047
. . .about the lrish potato famine?

204
00:12:14,932 --> 00:12:17,765
What about you?
You weren't so hot either.

205
00:12:18,012 --> 00:12:20,207
After everything he said,
he'd go--

206
00:12:22,812 --> 00:12:25,929
Monica doesn't like that either.
I should stop doing that.

207
00:12:26,732 --> 00:12:29,644
Girls don't like it when
I start talking about science.

208
00:12:29,892 --> 00:12:31,962
That's not specific to girls.

209
00:12:33,372 --> 00:12:35,681
This is great. What else?

210
00:12:35,932 --> 00:12:37,650
They don't like you correcting
their grammar.

211
00:12:37,892 --> 00:12:41,168
And they don't like it when you
explain why your jokes are funny.

212
00:12:42,532 --> 00:12:46,207
They don't like it when you
keep asking them if they like you.

213
00:12:47,092 --> 00:12:50,801
-Man, I am so lucky I have Monica.
-I'm never gonna find love again.

214
00:12:55,892 --> 00:12:58,360
-Can I talk to you for a second?
-Sure.

215
00:13:03,892 --> 00:13:06,964
Phoebe, I just wanted to say
I'm sorry, okay?

216
00:13:07,212 --> 00:13:09,248
I handled the situation horribly.

217
00:13:09,492 --> 00:13:11,767
And I should not have lied to you.

218
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:14,569
So what should you have done?

219
00:13:14,932 --> 00:13:16,968
I should have told you the truth.

220
00:13:17,932 --> 00:13:19,331
Which is?

221
00:13:19,892 --> 00:13:24,568
Well, the reason I didn't
want to go running with you is. . .

222
00:13:25,132 --> 00:13:26,247
. . .because. . .

223
00:13:26,452 --> 00:13:29,649
. . .the way that you run
is just a little. . . .

224
00:13:32,092 --> 00:13:33,491
-So?
-It's embarrassing.

225
00:13:33,732 --> 00:13:35,848
People were looking at us
like we were crazy.

226
00:13:36,052 --> 00:13:38,771
-Why do you care?
-Because they're people!

227
00:13:39,332 --> 00:13:41,892
People you don't know
and will never see again.

228
00:13:42,132 --> 00:13:44,168
Yes, but still they are people. . .

229
00:13:44,412 --> 00:13:45,640
. . .with eyes.

230
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:50,289
I didn't get embarrassed
running next to Miss. . . .

231
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:54,360
But okay.

232
00:13:54,612 --> 00:13:58,651
I can see why running with me
would be embarrassing to you.

233
00:13:58,852 --> 00:14:00,444
Okay. You're uptight.

234
00:14:00,652 --> 00:14:03,291
What? I am not uptight.

235
00:14:05,092 --> 00:14:08,971
I am not uptight, man.

236
00:14:10,732 --> 00:14:13,929
That's okay. I'm not judging you.
That's just who you are.

237
00:14:14,292 --> 00:14:17,443
I'm more free, you know.
I run like I did when I was a kid. . .

238
00:14:17,692 --> 00:14:20,286
. . .because that's the only way
it's fun, you know?

239
00:14:20,532 --> 00:14:23,842
Didn't you ever run so fast
you thought your legs would fall off. . .

240
00:14:24,052 --> 00:14:28,728
. . .Iike when you were running towards
the swings or running away from Satan?

241
00:14:32,292 --> 00:14:33,281
The neighbor's dog.

242
00:14:38,092 --> 00:14:39,525
Is this in the right place?

243
00:14:39,732 --> 00:14:41,848
Who cares? I repel women.

244
00:14:45,212 --> 00:14:46,486
You can't come in here!

245
00:14:46,732 --> 00:14:48,324
Ross is naked!

246
00:14:53,652 --> 00:14:56,849
I couldn't say I was naked,
because she's allowed to see me naked.

247
00:14:57,052 --> 00:14:59,282
Why does anyone have to be naked?

248
00:15:01,532 --> 00:15:03,443
Why is Ross naked?

249
00:15:05,852 --> 00:15:09,481
I had to show Chandler something.

250
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:13,088
Naked?

251
00:15:16,012 --> 00:15:17,843
I guess I have. . .

252
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:20,170
. . .a "guy" problem.

253
00:15:21,852 --> 00:15:24,446
Is it the same thing
Chandler had?

254
00:15:27,812 --> 00:15:31,691
We'll get everything squared away,
and you can come back later!

255
00:15:31,892 --> 00:15:35,805
There's still some of Chandler's
medicine in the bathroom.

256
00:15:37,292 --> 00:15:38,645
-Bye.
-Bye!

257
00:15:44,452 --> 00:15:45,601
Thank God.

258
00:15:49,212 --> 00:15:50,804
Dude, what'd you have?

259
00:15:52,492 --> 00:15:55,131
We have no time, okay?
We must focus.

260
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:58,045
We've got to get everything
back into its original place.

261
00:15:58,252 --> 00:15:59,162
The photo album!

262
00:15:59,412 --> 00:16:03,087
There were millions of pictures
of the apartment in the photo album.

263
00:16:03,332 --> 00:16:05,766
We just match everything
to the pictures!

264
00:16:06,012 --> 00:16:08,207
That's perfect! That's brilliant!

265
00:16:11,052 --> 00:16:12,121
What'd you have?

266
00:16:15,332 --> 00:16:17,323
I've got some beer for you.

267
00:16:18,612 --> 00:16:21,524
Don't you mean "for whom"?

268
00:16:23,412 --> 00:16:24,481
Sure.

269
00:16:25,492 --> 00:16:28,245
I was gonna order some pizza.
You wanna share one?

270
00:16:28,452 --> 00:16:31,649
Pizza? It's not like I never
had that before.

271
00:16:34,812 --> 00:16:36,006
Is something wrong?

272
00:16:37,412 --> 00:16:39,084
All right, all right.

273
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:42,085
Let's just get this
out in the open, okay?

274
00:16:42,332 --> 00:16:43,208
You're hot.

275
00:16:44,852 --> 00:16:45,762
I'm lovable.

276
00:16:46,812 --> 00:16:50,282
Clearly, there's a vibe
going on between us.

277
00:16:50,532 --> 00:16:51,647
But we're roommates. . .

278
00:16:51,892 --> 00:16:55,362
. . .and it's a huge mistake
for us to continue down this road.

279
00:16:56,652 --> 00:16:59,041
Imagine living in a supermarket. . .

280
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:00,605
. . .and you'll understand.

281
00:17:02,732 --> 00:17:06,247
Okay? So the question is,
what do we do?

282
00:17:06,452 --> 00:17:08,044
There isn't anything to do.

283
00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:10,681
I think you're really sweet.

284
00:17:10,892 --> 00:17:13,326
But I'm not interested
in you like that.

285
00:17:20,132 --> 00:17:21,087
No, I mean. . . .

286
00:17:22,052 --> 00:17:26,762
You're a nice guy, and I'm happy
to be your roommate and your friend.

287
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,889
I'm just, you know, I just. . .

288
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:32,204
. . .don't feel that way about you.

289
00:17:34,332 --> 00:17:36,766
I see what happened.

290
00:17:37,332 --> 00:17:39,926
It's because I was trying
to repel you.

291
00:17:40,132 --> 00:17:44,842
Right? Believe me, you'd feel
a lot different if I turned it on.

292
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:48,127
-I don't think so.
-Oh, I do.

293
00:17:51,092 --> 00:17:52,923
How you doing?

294
00:17:54,852 --> 00:17:55,728
I'm okay.

295
00:17:57,012 --> 00:17:57,808
What?

296
00:17:59,332 --> 00:18:00,287
What?

297
00:18:01,212 --> 00:18:03,009
Oh, dear God!

298
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:26,246
I'm so sorry. You're right.
This feels great!

299
00:18:26,492 --> 00:18:30,246
And you don't care if people stare.
It's only a second. Then you're gone!

300
00:18:31,252 --> 00:18:34,642
It's amazing!
I feel so free and so graceful!

301
00:18:39,772 --> 00:18:41,251
Watch out for the horse.

302
00:18:47,652 --> 00:18:49,085
Can I come in now?

303
00:18:57,692 --> 00:18:59,922
-Why is everything different?
-Bye.

304
00:19:02,932 --> 00:19:04,251
I don't see anything different. . .

305
00:19:04,452 --> 00:19:08,968
. . .other than the fact that the room
got brighter when you came into it.

306
00:19:09,572 --> 00:19:12,245
The end table is wrong,
the couch looks bizarre. . .

307
00:19:12,492 --> 00:19:15,643
. . .and don't even get me started
on the refrigerator magnets.

308
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,051
Okay, don't be mad, okay?

309
00:19:19,332 --> 00:19:23,245
After I unpacked the boxes, I wanted
to do something nice for you. . .

310
00:19:23,492 --> 00:19:26,245
. . .so I cleaned the apartment.

311
00:19:26,452 --> 00:19:29,888
So I moved everything around,
and then I forgot. . .

312
00:19:30,132 --> 00:19:33,249
. . .where it went back.
I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry.

313
00:19:34,892 --> 00:19:36,450
That's okay.

314
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,162
Are you afraid of me or something?

315
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,843
Do you want me to be afraid of you?

316
00:19:43,012 --> 00:19:44,684
Of course not.

317
00:19:45,252 --> 00:19:48,289
My gosh, Chandler, what you did
is a wonderful thing. . .

318
00:19:48,532 --> 00:19:50,250
. . .and I really appreciate it.

319
00:19:50,892 --> 00:19:53,770
I have this thing where I want
everything in the perfect place.

320
00:19:54,012 --> 00:19:56,321
But I'd never expect you
to worry about that.

321
00:19:57,012 --> 00:19:58,206
Really?

322
00:19:58,972 --> 00:20:00,087
Of course.

323
00:20:01,092 --> 00:20:02,491
Oh, you're the best.

324
00:20:02,852 --> 00:20:04,365
You come here to me.

325
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,528
Hold on, okay?
First things first.

326
00:20:09,252 --> 00:20:12,050
Did Ross sit anywhere
while he was naked?

327
00:20:17,212 --> 00:20:19,362
It said that by the year 2030. . .

328
00:20:19,612 --> 00:20:22,649
. . .there'll be computers carrying
out the same number of functions. . .

329
00:20:22,892 --> 00:20:24,848
. . .as an actual human brain.

330
00:20:25,092 --> 00:20:28,289
So, theoretically, you could
download your thoughts. . .

331
00:20:28,532 --> 00:20:30,648
. . .and your memories
into this computer--

332
00:20:30,852 --> 00:20:33,127
And live forever as a machine.

333
00:20:37,772 --> 00:20:40,764
Janine, do you know
what we're doing right now?

334
00:20:42,132 --> 00:20:44,646
You and l, we're interfacing.

335
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:47,604
I gotta go.
