00:00:05,692 --> 00:00:08,570
Hi, my name's Chandler.
I just moved in next door.

2
00:00:08,812 --> 00:00:11,645
Would you like to battle me
in a post-apocalyptic world. . .

3
00:00:11,852 --> 00:00:15,447
. . .for control of the galaxy's
last remaining energy source?

4
00:00:16,252 --> 00:00:18,129
Sure, neighbor! Come on in!

5
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:20,487
Is Janine around?

6
00:00:20,732 --> 00:00:22,085
She's at dance class.

7
00:00:22,332 --> 00:00:23,526
Can I check my room?

8
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:26,485
Don't go through her stuff.
She gets really mad.

9
00:00:30,132 --> 00:00:31,645
Oh, my God!

10
00:00:31,852 --> 00:00:34,525
It's like a guy never lived in here.

11
00:00:35,252 --> 00:00:38,847
You gotta be careful. This girl
thing is dangerous. It's spreading.

12
00:00:39,492 --> 00:00:40,481
It is?

13
00:00:40,932 --> 00:00:44,322
Is this your pretty pink pillow
on the couch?

14
00:00:45,652 --> 00:00:49,201
Is that your tiny little box that's
too small to put anything in?

15
00:00:50,612 --> 00:00:53,729
Okay, this is not good.
You are a guy, okay?

16
00:00:53,932 --> 00:00:55,524
This is a "guy's" place.

17
00:00:55,732 --> 00:00:58,724
Soon, you'll be soaking
your fingers in stuff.

18
00:01:00,012 --> 00:01:03,288
-You're right. I'll talk to her.
-Talk to her. Be a man!

19
00:01:03,492 --> 00:01:05,244
-I'm a man.
-Defend yourself!

20
00:01:06,732 --> 00:01:08,768
We have to hem the new dust ruffle.

21
00:01:08,972 --> 00:01:10,451
Be right there, sweetums.

22
00:01:12,932 --> 00:01:14,365
Totally different situation.

23
00:01:16,772 --> 00:01:18,728
The One With Ross' Teeth

25
00:01:54,652 --> 00:01:55,448
Hey, guys.

26
00:01:55,652 --> 00:01:57,643
-How was breakfast with Hillary?
-Okay.

27
00:01:57,852 --> 00:02:01,367
She's still depressed because
she broke up with her boyfriend.

28
00:02:01,572 --> 00:02:04,848
Is this Hillary, your
hot assistant chef, Hillary?

29
00:02:05,852 --> 00:02:08,241
The one that stares at me
when I come in?

30
00:02:08,692 --> 00:02:12,241
The one who looked at you once
because you got in her way.

31
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:15,526
Still, I could tell. She was into me.

32
00:02:17,652 --> 00:02:18,880
Why don't you set us up?

33
00:02:19,092 --> 00:02:22,846
Are you setting Ross up with someone?
Does she have a wedding dress?

34
00:02:26,612 --> 00:02:27,408
Rachel?

35
00:02:27,612 --> 00:02:31,321
I'm making up flyers to try
to get new massage clients.

36
00:02:31,532 --> 00:02:34,046
Can I come to Bloomingdale's
and use the copier?

37
00:02:34,252 --> 00:02:38,450
Sure, but they might think it's weird
since I don't work there anymore.

38
00:02:39,332 --> 00:02:41,288
Oh, my God! What happened?

39
00:02:41,532 --> 00:02:43,329
I got a job at Ralph Lauren.

40
00:02:43,652 --> 00:02:45,882
Well, that's great! Congratulations!

41
00:02:47,932 --> 00:02:49,684
A year ago.

42
00:02:51,052 --> 00:02:53,168
You've lasted all year! Good for you.

43
00:02:56,012 --> 00:02:59,209
You could still use the copier
where I actually work.

44
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:02,051
But come by at lunch
so my boss doesn't see you.

45
00:03:02,292 --> 00:03:04,408
Kim will freak out.
She doesn't like me.

46
00:03:04,612 --> 00:03:07,843
-I don't think my boss likes me.
-I don't think mine likes me.

47
00:03:08,532 --> 00:03:10,807
Maybe it's a universal thing.

48
00:03:11,012 --> 00:03:14,561
Maybe because you're all hanging
around here at 1 1 :30 on a Wednesday.

49
00:03:17,532 --> 00:03:19,045
Let's head off to work.

50
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,050
-Thank you.
-Sure.

51
00:03:26,252 --> 00:03:27,970
You will not believe this.

52
00:03:28,172 --> 00:03:30,970
I was making copies,
and Ralph Lauren came in.

53
00:03:31,172 --> 00:03:33,083
Oh, my God. Did you talk to him?

54
00:03:33,292 --> 00:03:35,283
A little. He seems really nice.

55
00:03:35,492 --> 00:03:37,448
-Good kisser.
-What?

56
00:03:37,932 --> 00:03:39,331
What?

57
00:03:39,772 --> 00:03:41,205
-You kissed him?
-Totally.

58
00:03:42,052 --> 00:03:43,770
Phoebe, are you serious?

59
00:03:44,332 --> 00:03:46,368
He came in and introduced himself.

60
00:03:46,612 --> 00:03:49,729
The next thing I know,
we're making out!

61
00:03:50,492 --> 00:03:52,847
Phoebe, you do know he's married?

62
00:03:55,092 --> 00:03:56,002
Phoebe.

63
00:03:56,212 --> 00:03:59,522
I'm supposed to ask every guy
I make out with if he's married?

64
00:04:01,132 --> 00:04:02,281
No, yeah, I should.

65
00:04:14,612 --> 00:04:15,840
Hey, Joey.

66
00:04:16,132 --> 00:04:19,761
Can I talk to you for a second?
There's a kid in this picture.

67
00:04:19,972 --> 00:04:22,645
Do you know this kid?
ls it a relative?

68
00:04:22,852 --> 00:04:24,683
No. I just thought it was cute.

69
00:04:24,892 --> 00:04:27,247
That's what I was afraid of. Okay. . . .

70
00:04:28,132 --> 00:04:30,885
I really want you to feel
at home here, but. . .

71
00:04:31,092 --> 00:04:33,890
. . .some of this new stuff,
it's too girlie.

72
00:04:35,092 --> 00:04:35,968
Like what?

73
00:04:36,172 --> 00:04:39,528
Like this.
Pictures of cute babies we don't know.

74
00:04:40,012 --> 00:04:41,411
We can't have that.

75
00:04:41,732 --> 00:04:44,292
Joey, it's Anne Geddes.
She's a famous artist.

76
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:48,644
I don't know this baby. I don't know
if she's a famous artist or not.

77
00:04:50,892 --> 00:04:55,044
I don't want to be a jerk, but
you're changing too much around here.

78
00:04:55,252 --> 00:04:58,369
I'm sorry. I wanted to make
the place a little nicer.

79
00:04:58,572 --> 00:05:00,085
But it's too much stuff.

80
00:05:00,332 --> 00:05:04,450
You know, you got the candles and
the "foofy schmoofer" thing here.

81
00:05:04,652 --> 00:05:08,440
Over here, you got
a picture of a watering can.

82
00:05:09,132 --> 00:05:09,928
I just thought--

83
00:05:10,132 --> 00:05:12,646
I'm sure it's a famous watering can.

84
00:05:12,852 --> 00:05:13,682
But come on.

85
00:05:13,932 --> 00:05:17,208
And what is with the really hot stick
in the bathroom?

86
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:19,890
It's a curling iron.

87
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:27,850
Well, that's okay then.

88
00:05:28,092 --> 00:05:31,368
Okay, my towels, for instance.
I come into the bathroom. . .

89
00:05:31,612 --> 00:05:35,446
. . .and my towel is not on the floor,
where I keep it.

90
00:05:36,452 --> 00:05:40,365
It's up here on some hook.
And it smells different.

91
00:05:40,572 --> 00:05:41,368
It's clean.

92
00:05:41,572 --> 00:05:43,290
It feels different.

93
00:05:43,492 --> 00:05:44,845
It's dry.

94
00:05:47,012 --> 00:05:49,890
All right, I can make my peace
with the clean, dry towels.

95
00:05:50,412 --> 00:05:53,165
Also what is with
these chips you bought?

96
00:05:53,372 --> 00:05:56,045
It's potpourri.
You're supposed to smell it.

97
00:06:03,612 --> 00:06:05,648
Well, that's like summer in a bowl.

98
00:06:17,052 --> 00:06:18,485
Kim, hi.

99
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:28,047
I handed in that marketing report, and
I never got to hear what you thought.

100
00:06:28,452 --> 00:06:29,328
I didn't read it.

101
00:06:33,332 --> 00:06:36,563
The spring line's really gonna be
great this year, huh?

102
00:06:42,692 --> 00:06:46,162
I hear Ralph Lauren fooled around
with someone in the copy room.

103
00:06:48,292 --> 00:06:49,771
Tell me everything.

104
00:06:53,332 --> 00:06:54,481
Hey, guys.

105
00:06:55,212 --> 00:06:56,440
What's up?

106
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:00,246
You know. . . .

107
00:07:00,532 --> 00:07:02,045
Oh, my God.

108
00:07:03,052 --> 00:07:04,531
What happened to your teeth?

109
00:07:04,732 --> 00:07:06,051
I whitened them.

110
00:07:08,532 --> 00:07:09,647
Really?

111
00:07:10,612 --> 00:07:12,364
What do you think?

112
00:07:12,572 --> 00:07:15,040
I think I shouldn't look
directly at them.

113
00:07:15,532 --> 00:07:17,443
Come on, seriously.

114
00:07:19,412 --> 00:07:23,451
-They're really, really, really white.
-What was wrong with your old. . .

115
00:07:23,692 --> 00:07:25,284
. . .human teeth?

116
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:29,643
I did leave the gel on
a little longer than it said to.

117
00:07:30,132 --> 00:07:32,726
-How much longer?
-A day.

118
00:07:34,132 --> 00:07:36,202
Tonight is your date with Hillary.

119
00:07:36,412 --> 00:07:40,246
I know. That's why I did it.
Are they really that bad?

120
00:07:42,412 --> 00:07:45,404
You'll be fine.
Hillary's blind, right?

121
00:07:46,252 --> 00:07:48,049
She will be after tonight.

122
00:07:50,412 --> 00:07:52,403
Oh, Rach.
Do you notice anything--?

123
00:07:52,612 --> 00:07:55,001
Your teeth?
Yes, I saw them from outside.

124
00:07:56,452 --> 00:07:59,410
You guys are never gonna
believe this. . .

125
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:03,651
. . .but Phoebe made out
with Ralph Lauren.

126
00:08:03,852 --> 00:08:05,080
-What?
-Oh, my God!

127
00:08:05,292 --> 00:08:08,648
She ran into him at my office,
and they just made out.

128
00:08:08,852 --> 00:08:11,650
The craziest thing is,
now my boss likes me because. . .

129
00:08:11,852 --> 00:08:14,207
. . .it's the best gossip
she's heard all year.

130
00:08:14,412 --> 00:08:17,051
I am proud of all my friends today.

131
00:08:17,932 --> 00:08:20,890
I can't believe Phoebe made out
with Ralph Lauren.

132
00:08:21,132 --> 00:08:23,202
I'm so jealous!

133
00:08:24,132 --> 00:08:26,566
Hi, I'm Chandler,
your live-in boyfriend.

134
00:08:27,612 --> 00:08:29,648
Chandler, please. Come on.

135
00:08:29,852 --> 00:08:31,251
Look at him.

136
00:08:31,452 --> 00:08:35,047
Well, I am no woman,
but that is one tasty dish.

137
00:08:37,732 --> 00:08:38,767
Here.

138
00:08:39,012 --> 00:08:41,048
Who's the silver fox?

139
00:08:42,212 --> 00:08:45,522
That is your make-out buddy.
Don't you recognize him?

140
00:08:45,772 --> 00:08:46,648
Oh, wait.

141
00:08:46,932 --> 00:08:50,242
"Phoebe, I love you.
Kiss me, please. "

142
00:08:50,892 --> 00:08:54,043
That's not Ralph Lauren.
It sounds like him, though.

143
00:08:54,892 --> 00:08:55,688
What?

144
00:08:55,892 --> 00:08:58,087
Ralph doesn't look like that guy.

145
00:08:58,332 --> 00:09:02,928
He's young, and he's got long hair
and a beard and a Hacky Sack--

146
00:09:03,132 --> 00:09:07,125
Oh, my God. That's not Ralph Lauren.
That's Kenny the copy guy!

147
00:09:08,292 --> 00:09:09,088
What?

148
00:09:09,932 --> 00:09:12,765
I told my boss that someone
made out with Ralph Lauren.

149
00:09:13,012 --> 00:09:17,085
If she finds out that I lied to her,
she'll hate me even more. Phoebe!

150
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:19,726
Why would the copy guy say
he's Ralph Lauren?

151
00:09:19,932 --> 00:09:21,684
To get you to make out with him!

152
00:09:28,732 --> 00:09:30,643
This will make them look less white.

153
00:09:35,612 --> 00:09:36,567
Nope.

154
00:09:37,692 --> 00:09:39,489
Colors that don't work are. . .

155
00:09:39,732 --> 00:09:43,611
. . .blue, yellow, green, red, black,
white, orange and purple.

156
00:09:45,212 --> 00:09:48,443
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
The date starts in an hour.

157
00:09:49,092 --> 00:09:53,802
Maybe if your skin was lighter,
your teeth wouldn't look so bright.

158
00:09:54,012 --> 00:09:57,891
Oh, great! So all I need to do
is get some new skin. Thank you.

159
00:09:58,572 --> 00:10:01,086
If we put just a little bit
of makeup on you--

160
00:10:01,332 --> 00:10:02,765
Whoa!

161
00:10:02,972 --> 00:10:05,167
We're not 1 3 anymore.

162
00:10:07,172 --> 00:10:09,970
This is the only thing left
that has a shot at working.

163
00:10:10,172 --> 00:10:12,049
Won't she notice I have makeup on?

164
00:10:12,252 --> 00:10:14,368
Half the guys out there
have makeup on.

165
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,846
What?

166
00:10:16,812 --> 00:10:19,690
Half the people-- I mean--
Just try it and see.

167
00:10:19,892 --> 00:10:22,087
I am not putting on makeup.

168
00:10:22,692 --> 00:10:26,605
Hello? Ross, could you put up
some of these flyers for me?

169
00:10:26,812 --> 00:10:28,530
No! Demon! Demon!

170
00:10:35,292 --> 00:10:39,251
Our drawers will smell nice, and
we didn't waste these pantyhose.

171
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:42,242
God forbid we throw out old underwear.

172
00:10:43,612 --> 00:10:46,001
You know what?
I'm gonna go over to Joey's.

173
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,203
We've got to organize
the wrapping paper.

174
00:10:49,932 --> 00:10:53,049
I've really gotten in touch with
my feminine side enough today.

175
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:56,483
In fact, we're two sachets away
from becoming a lesbian couple.

176
00:10:58,972 --> 00:11:01,645
This has been a girlie day.
You're right. I'm sorry.

177
00:11:01,852 --> 00:11:04,286
I just feel like I need
to be in a "guy" place. . .

178
00:11:04,532 --> 00:11:06,409
. . .do kind of a "man" thing.

179
00:11:06,612 --> 00:11:08,887
You go over to Joey's and. . .

180
00:11:09,132 --> 00:11:11,930
. . .drink some beer and
hammer up some dry wall.

181
00:11:12,732 --> 00:11:16,327
When guys hang out, they don't just
drink beer and hammer up dry wall.

182
00:11:16,532 --> 00:11:20,047
When girls hang out, we don't have
pillow fights in our underwear.

183
00:11:22,252 --> 00:11:24,049
I'm sorry. We do.

184
00:11:24,252 --> 00:11:25,844
I don't know why I said that.

185
00:11:30,052 --> 00:11:31,451
Hey, Chandler.

186
00:11:32,612 --> 00:11:34,842
Come on in.
We're knitting potholders.

187
00:11:36,732 --> 00:11:38,450
No, thanks, Josephine.

188
00:11:42,332 --> 00:11:43,731
Ross, I was wondering if--

189
00:11:47,892 --> 00:11:50,884
Oh, my God! Where are all the men?

190
00:12:01,732 --> 00:12:04,246
-Hi, Kim.
-Hi, Rachel.

191
00:12:04,812 --> 00:12:08,691
Remember what happened yesterday?
Well, it didn't happen.

192
00:12:08,892 --> 00:12:11,201
You didn't cancel the fabric order?

193
00:12:12,252 --> 00:12:14,447
Okay, two things didn't happen.

194
00:12:14,732 --> 00:12:17,485
Remember I told you someone
made out with Ralph Lauren?

195
00:12:17,732 --> 00:12:20,121
Well, it turns out that's not true.

196
00:12:20,332 --> 00:12:22,288
It's not true?
That's interesting.

197
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:26,849
Because I checked. Only one keycard
was used to access the copier. . .

198
00:12:27,052 --> 00:12:30,647
. . .yesterday during lunch, and
that keycard belonged to you.

199
00:12:31,212 --> 00:12:32,884
You think I made out with him?

200
00:12:33,092 --> 00:12:33,888
Listen to me. . .

201
00:12:34,092 --> 00:12:37,880
. . .sleeping with Ralph is not
gonna get you my job.

202
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:40,242
I don't want your job. I don't.

203
00:12:40,452 --> 00:12:42,682
This is a mistake.
I didn't make out with him.

204
00:12:42,932 --> 00:12:46,641
Nobody made out with him.
I didn't use my keycard yesterday.

205
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:49,247
I don't even know
how to use my keycard.

206
00:12:51,012 --> 00:12:52,525
-Hi, Ralph.
-Hi, Kim.

207
00:13:11,252 --> 00:13:12,605
Yeah. Nothing happened.

208
00:13:12,812 --> 00:13:16,009
You could cut the sexual tension
in here with a knife.

209
00:13:22,412 --> 00:13:24,801
After that, what could I do
except become a chef?

210
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:29,127
Soon, I hope to open
my own restaurant.

211
00:13:32,132 --> 00:13:34,248
You're a really great listener.

212
00:13:34,492 --> 00:13:36,847
Most guys I go out with,
they talk and talk.

213
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:42,327
It's like, "Shut your mouth. "
You know?

214
00:13:45,252 --> 00:13:48,244
I've been talking too much.
Why don't we talk about you?

215
00:13:51,092 --> 00:13:52,411
Come on, I want to know.

216
00:13:56,052 --> 00:13:58,486
Okay. I'm from Long lsland.

217
00:13:58,732 --> 00:14:02,168
I came to the city for college.

218
00:14:02,412 --> 00:14:06,041
I have a 5-year-old son,
and in my spare time. . .

219
00:14:06,292 --> 00:14:10,649
. . .I like to read spy novels.
But let's talk more about you.

220
00:14:14,852 --> 00:14:19,130
If you sear the stems of the flowers
first in a frying pan. . .

221
00:14:19,332 --> 00:14:22,051
. . .your arrangement will
look fresh much longer.

222
00:14:22,732 --> 00:14:24,962
Joey, that is such a great tip!

223
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:29,602
Monica, I need to talk
to the girl with the flowers.

224
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,688
Okay, but I'm gonna teach you
how to make a bird feeder. . .

225
00:14:34,932 --> 00:14:37,526
. . .out of a pine cone
and some peanut butter.

226
00:14:38,532 --> 00:14:39,885
I love birds.

227
00:14:41,852 --> 00:14:43,604
What is the matter with you?

228
00:14:44,412 --> 00:14:46,004
-What?
-You're arranging flowers!

229
00:14:47,532 --> 00:14:49,488
You got dead flowers!

230
00:14:49,732 --> 00:14:52,530
You've got a picture of a baby
dressed like flowers!

231
00:14:54,412 --> 00:14:55,527
This is not Joey!

232
00:14:55,732 --> 00:14:58,690
Look, I am still Joey, okay?

233
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:01,685
Flowers, they're just nice to look at.

234
00:15:01,892 --> 00:15:06,249
And that happens to be a picture
by a famous artist of a famous baby.

235
00:15:07,252 --> 00:15:09,049
You're turning into a woman.

236
00:15:09,612 --> 00:15:11,045
No, I'm not.

237
00:15:11,292 --> 00:15:13,647
Why would you say that?
That's just mean.

238
00:15:15,932 --> 00:15:18,127
Now I've upset you? What did I say?

239
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:21,246
It's not what you said.
It's the way you said it.

240
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:23,361
Oh, my God!

241
00:15:23,612 --> 00:15:25,330
I'm a woman!

242
00:15:31,812 --> 00:15:35,487
So now she thinks that I made out
with him to get her job.

243
00:15:35,732 --> 00:15:38,166
-Why didn't you just tell the truth?
-I did.

244
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:43,287
She doesn't think anyone would confuse
Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.

245
00:15:44,412 --> 00:15:47,927
What if Kenny were the real brains
behind the whole company?

246
00:15:48,132 --> 00:15:51,761
What if Kenny hired that Ralph guy
to be the pretty front man, huh?

247
00:15:52,012 --> 00:15:53,650
Did she ever think of that?

248
00:15:57,732 --> 00:15:59,563
You were with Kenny today.

249
00:15:59,772 --> 00:16:01,490
Just for a second.

250
00:16:02,652 --> 00:16:04,449
Phoebe, what am I gonna do?

251
00:16:05,652 --> 00:16:07,882
The only thing you can do.
Sleep with him.

252
00:16:09,332 --> 00:16:14,247
I'm not gonna sleep with him.
I mean, I could, but I wouldn't.

253
00:16:15,532 --> 00:16:16,601
Sleep with Kenny.

254
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:23,449
-That wouldn't help me.
-Oh, yes, it would.

255
00:16:26,532 --> 00:16:28,568
I've had a really good time tonight.

256
00:16:28,812 --> 00:16:32,248
I rarely connect with someone
this much on the first date.

257
00:16:34,492 --> 00:16:35,845
Me neither.

258
00:16:37,532 --> 00:16:40,251
I've had a really
good time too, you know.

259
00:16:42,332 --> 00:16:43,845
Are you gonna eat that bread?

260
00:16:45,052 --> 00:16:47,646
I just like the smell.

261
00:16:50,732 --> 00:16:51,721
You make me laugh.

262
00:16:54,052 --> 00:16:56,088
Would you like to move to the couch?

263
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,280
Maybe I'll just turn down
the lights a little?

264
00:17:05,132 --> 00:17:07,043
How about all the way?

265
00:17:07,492 --> 00:17:08,641
Okay.

266
00:17:15,612 --> 00:17:17,250
Wow, cool poster.

267
00:17:17,452 --> 00:17:20,842
Or should I say, "groovy poster"?

268
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:23,520
So. . .

269
00:17:24,932 --> 00:17:26,445
. . .where were we?

270
00:17:31,052 --> 00:17:32,690
Are those your teeth?

271
00:17:35,812 --> 00:17:38,087
You can see them, huh?

272
00:17:38,332 --> 00:17:40,846
Yes. They're insanely white.

273
00:17:41,452 --> 00:17:43,249
I did that for you.

274
00:17:45,132 --> 00:17:47,043
What's the matter with you?

275
00:17:47,452 --> 00:17:51,843
What's the matter with me?
You've got a black light. It's 1 999!

276
00:17:59,332 --> 00:18:01,163
Oh, good. Kim, hi.

277
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:05,968
Hi, Rachel. I wanted to ask you, have
you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets?

278
00:18:06,212 --> 00:18:09,249
What am I thinking?
Of course you have.

279
00:18:09,652 --> 00:18:10,880
Okay, look.

280
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:13,248
I'm sorry that I lied to you before.

281
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:18,043
You were right. Ralph and I were
an item, but we're not anymore.

282
00:18:18,252 --> 00:18:19,321
Oh, really?

283
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:21,848
Yeah, he dumped me.

284
00:18:22,892 --> 00:18:26,282
He said, "Rachel, I can't do this.

285
00:18:26,532 --> 00:18:29,569
Even though you're a very, very. . .

286
00:18:29,812 --> 00:18:32,042
. . .very beautiful woman. . .

287
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:35,688
. . .I can't do this.
I'm married and I'm sorry. "

288
00:18:35,932 --> 00:18:39,049
But he said,
"And you will never get promoted. . .

289
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:43,040
. . .especially not above Kim,
who is an integral cog. . .

290
00:18:43,292 --> 00:18:44,964
. . .in the Ralph Lauren machine. "

291
00:18:47,332 --> 00:18:49,641
You expect me to believe--

292
00:18:50,932 --> 00:18:52,524
-Hi, Ralph.
-Hi, Kim.

293
00:19:10,572 --> 00:19:12,164
Oh, my God.

294
00:19:12,412 --> 00:19:17,327
He gave you the coldest look I've
ever seen. It's like he hates you!

295
00:19:17,612 --> 00:19:19,045
Then it is true!

296
00:19:20,332 --> 00:19:24,644
Of course it's true.
And it hurts so bad.

297
00:19:25,412 --> 00:19:27,482
Oh, honey, come here.

298
00:19:27,732 --> 00:19:29,484
Oh, it'll be okay.

299
00:19:30,492 --> 00:19:33,052
We've all been there.

300
00:19:35,932 --> 00:19:37,524
You and Ralph?

301
00:19:38,932 --> 00:19:40,923
Kenny the copy boy.

302
00:19:54,492 --> 00:19:57,529
-I need to talk to you.
-What's the matter? You upset?

303
00:19:57,732 --> 00:20:00,690
We gotta get rid of all
this girlie stuff in here.

304
00:20:00,932 --> 00:20:02,081
I gotta be a man!

305
00:20:02,852 --> 00:20:06,242
The living room has to
remain a guy place, okay?

306
00:20:06,492 --> 00:20:08,164
That's the way it has to be.

307
00:20:08,372 --> 00:20:10,886
I'll just put it all in my room.

308
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:12,684
Good. Great.

309
00:20:12,932 --> 00:20:15,287
Thanks for being so understanding.

310
00:20:15,532 --> 00:20:18,092
I didn't want to make
a big deal out of this.

311
00:20:19,412 --> 00:20:22,643
But you could put the picture
of the famous baby in my room.

312
00:20:22,892 --> 00:20:24,610
I mean, if you want to.

313
00:20:26,932 --> 00:20:27,762
Okay.

314
00:20:28,012 --> 00:20:30,651
And maybe the watering can there.

315
00:20:30,932 --> 00:20:31,728
Sure.

316
00:20:31,932 --> 00:20:34,446
And a couple of these
little tiny boxes.

317
00:20:35,732 --> 00:20:38,769
Joey, do you want me to put
it all in your room?

318
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:39,882
Okay.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
