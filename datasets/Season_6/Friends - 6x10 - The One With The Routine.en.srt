1
00:00:02,652 --> 00:00:06,281
Why is everybody using
these tiny little lights nowadays?

2
00:00:06,532 --> 00:00:08,488
I remember when people used big ones.

3
00:00:08,692 --> 00:00:11,081
That's a good story, Grandpa.

4
00:00:14,772 --> 00:00:18,606
Wow. Monica's letting other people
help decorate her tree?

5
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,968
Did someone get her
drunk again, or. . .?

6
00:00:22,612 --> 00:00:25,570
Having a perfect tree is
not what Christmas is about.

7
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:27,610
It's about being with loved ones.

8
00:00:27,852 --> 00:00:30,207
That is nice. And we're done.
Ta-da!

9
00:00:32,292 --> 00:00:35,329
It just doesn't quite
feel like Christmas to me.

10
00:00:36,092 --> 00:00:37,810
Oh, here.

11
00:00:40,972 --> 00:00:42,644
See, now it feels like Christmas.

12
00:00:44,492 --> 00:00:46,483
The One With the Routine

13
00:00:48,972 --> 00:00:49,961
English Subtitles by
Gelula/SDI

14
00:01:22,852 --> 00:01:25,207
And that's the story of the dreidel.

15
00:01:27,292 --> 00:01:31,001
Some people trace the Christmas tree
back to the Egyptians. . .

16
00:01:31,212 --> 00:01:35,728
. . .who'd bring palm branches into huts
on the shortest day of the year. . .

17
00:01:35,972 --> 00:01:38,406
. . .symbolizing life's
triumph over death.

18
00:01:38,652 --> 00:01:41,450
And that was, like, 4000 years ago.

19
00:01:41,692 --> 00:01:45,162
So, around the same time
that you started telling this story.

20
00:01:48,492 --> 00:01:50,528
-Hey, you guys.
-Hey. What's up?

21
00:01:50,772 --> 00:01:54,845
I had to get out of the apartment.
Janine's stretching all over the place.

22
00:01:55,092 --> 00:01:57,003
Everywhere I look she's like. . . .

23
00:02:01,132 --> 00:02:03,600
I can see why that's hard to resist.

24
00:02:04,092 --> 00:02:05,969
I like her so much.

25
00:02:06,212 --> 00:02:07,930
I'm sorry she doesn't feel the same.

26
00:02:08,172 --> 00:02:09,810
I know. And she's so sweet.

27
00:02:10,052 --> 00:02:13,601
I just want to feed her grapes
and brush her hair.

28
00:02:14,572 --> 00:02:17,086
You are aware that she's
not a monkey, right?

29
00:02:19,612 --> 00:02:22,490
I am so over Janine.

30
00:02:23,172 --> 00:02:27,962
Yeah, at first I thought she was hot,
but now she's like old news.

31
00:02:28,572 --> 00:02:30,802
-Hey, guys.
-Janine!

32
00:02:33,292 --> 00:02:36,204
I'm gonna be a dancer on a TV special
for New Year's Eve.

33
00:02:36,452 --> 00:02:40,206
It's called some sort of
Dickin ' Rockin ' Dicky Eve.

34
00:02:43,052 --> 00:02:44,405
Hold it.

35
00:02:44,892 --> 00:02:48,202
Are you talking about
Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin ' Eve?

36
00:02:48,452 --> 00:02:50,204
Yeah, that's what I said.

37
00:02:52,692 --> 00:02:55,411
Oh, my God, we love that show!

38
00:02:55,652 --> 00:02:58,530
Ross and I have been watching it
since I can remember.

39
00:02:58,772 --> 00:03:02,003
You're still just a little
fat girl inside, aren't you?

40
00:03:04,052 --> 00:03:06,566
I'm gonna be one of the party people.

41
00:03:06,892 --> 00:03:11,408
You're gonna be a party person?
Those guys rock the most!

42
00:03:11,812 --> 00:03:15,043
They said to bring someone.
Want to be my dance partner?

43
00:03:15,292 --> 00:03:17,886
I would love to spend
New Year's with you.

44
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:20,771
They're taping tomorrow.
I don't understand why--

45
00:03:21,012 --> 00:03:22,411
Well, how it works is. . .

46
00:03:22,612 --> 00:03:26,241
. . .the part with Dick Clark
in Times Square is actually live.

47
00:03:26,492 --> 00:03:29,404
But they tape some of the party stuff
ahead of time.

48
00:03:29,652 --> 00:03:31,882
Not a lot of people know that.

49
00:03:33,292 --> 00:03:34,850
Do you guys want to come too?

50
00:03:35,612 --> 00:03:38,604
-Are you serious?
-We are there!

51
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,564
What are you laughing at?

52
00:03:43,812 --> 00:03:47,566
Well, I used to date him,
but you're still going out with her.

53
00:03:50,372 --> 00:03:52,806
Thanks.
Great, so we can all go together.

54
00:03:53,012 --> 00:03:54,923
I gotta run. I'll catch you later.

55
00:03:55,492 --> 00:03:57,403
Bye, Janine.

56
00:03:59,292 --> 00:04:01,203
Did she just ask me out on a date?

57
00:04:01,812 --> 00:04:04,007
I don't think so.

58
00:04:04,292 --> 00:04:07,489
She invited him to the biggest
party of the millennium.

59
00:04:07,732 --> 00:04:10,121
Yeah, but she also invited
you and Ross.

60
00:04:10,372 --> 00:04:13,444
I'm sorry, I don't think that
that was a romantic thing.

61
00:04:13,652 --> 00:04:16,450
Well, maybe.
But, hey, I know how I can find out.

62
00:04:16,692 --> 00:04:18,330
It's a New Year's Eve party.

63
00:04:18,572 --> 00:04:22,804
So at midnight, I can kiss her.
And if she kisses me back, great.

64
00:04:23,492 --> 00:04:25,722
If she says, "What are you doing?"

65
00:04:25,972 --> 00:04:28,611
I can say, "It wasn't me,
it was New Year's. "

66
00:04:30,572 --> 00:04:33,132
That's better than Ross
kissing me in high school. . .

67
00:04:33,372 --> 00:04:36,808
. . .and saying that he did it
because he needed Chap Stick.

68
00:04:38,972 --> 00:04:40,769
It was a dry day.

69
00:04:44,012 --> 00:04:48,210
We are going to Dick Clark's
New Year's Rockin ' Eve!

70
00:04:48,452 --> 00:04:50,204
Oh, my God!

71
00:04:50,452 --> 00:04:52,408
Oh, my God!

72
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:54,530
Oh, my God!

73
00:05:01,572 --> 00:05:03,528
Okay, I've been on sets before. . .

74
00:05:03,772 --> 00:05:05,410
. . .so let me give you some advice.

75
00:05:05,612 --> 00:05:08,843
It's a show, but we're just dancing.
It's no big deal.

76
00:05:09,092 --> 00:05:12,004
Important thing to remember:
Stay cool.

77
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:13,804
-Got it.
-Okay.

78
00:05:14,372 --> 00:05:17,011
Oh, my God!
It's just like I dreamed it!

79
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:19,520
Everyone! Gather up!

80
00:05:20,372 --> 00:05:22,408
-Excuse us!
-Excuse us!

81
00:05:23,492 --> 00:05:26,052
The music's gonna start,
you're gonna dance. . .

82
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:29,250
. . .we'll tape it. Don't look
at the camera. Questions?

83
00:05:29,492 --> 00:05:33,007
Yeah, I have a question.
When is this gonna air?

84
00:05:34,412 --> 00:05:36,846
Yeah. Now, you guys dance
over there. . .

85
00:05:37,092 --> 00:05:39,731
. . .you guys, over there.
I want you two here.

86
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,803
And everyone else, spread out.

87
00:05:43,812 --> 00:05:45,609
So when is it gonna air?

88
00:05:50,612 --> 00:05:52,807
You look in the kitchen,
I got the closet.

89
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:56,203
I can save you time, ladies.
I'm right here.

90
00:05:57,052 --> 00:06:01,011
Yeah. Why don't you take a walk?
This doesn't concern you.

91
00:06:02,092 --> 00:06:04,401
We're looking for our presents
from Monica.

92
00:06:04,652 --> 00:06:05,846
That's terrible.

93
00:06:06,092 --> 00:06:07,650
No, we do it every year.

94
00:06:07,892 --> 00:06:10,201
Oh, well, that makes it not terrible.

95
00:06:11,692 --> 00:06:13,125
Yeah, we never find them.

96
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:17,047
She's always bested us,
that wily. . .minx.

97
00:06:17,892 --> 00:06:19,803
We'll search here for an hour. . .

98
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:22,606
. . .and then we'll go to Joey's
and search, okay?

99
00:06:22,852 --> 00:06:26,049
-You can't look for Monica's presents.
-We have to.

100
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:30,211
You don't have to. And you can't,
because I live here too.

101
00:06:31,292 --> 00:06:33,886
Well, then you should look with us.

102
00:06:34,612 --> 00:06:35,408
Why?

103
00:06:35,652 --> 00:06:38,246
Aren't you worried about
what to get Monica?

104
00:06:38,492 --> 00:06:40,608
No, I have a great idea
for her present.

105
00:06:40,852 --> 00:06:43,685
Oh, that's it?
A great idea? Oh, yeah?

106
00:06:44,812 --> 00:06:47,326
What if she gets you
a great present. . .

107
00:06:47,572 --> 00:06:49,608
. . .two mediums
and lots of little ones. . .

108
00:06:49,812 --> 00:06:52,849
. . .and you just get her one present?
She'll feel bad.

109
00:06:53,092 --> 00:06:55,526
Why would you do that to her?
Why? Why?

110
00:06:57,452 --> 00:06:59,488
-If I help, we can find them faster!
-Right!

111
00:07:02,052 --> 00:07:03,007
We have a live one!

112
00:07:03,212 --> 00:07:05,806
-Oh, it's a Macy's bag!
-Yeah.

113
00:07:06,812 --> 00:07:09,201
Who's it for?

114
00:07:10,892 --> 00:07:14,851
"Dear Losers, do you really think
I'd hide presents under the couch?

115
00:07:16,492 --> 00:07:18,722
P.S. Chandler,
I knew they'd break you. "

116
00:07:21,932 --> 00:07:24,400
Uh-oh. She may be onto us.

117
00:07:25,252 --> 00:07:28,130
We are so gonna find them this year.

118
00:07:28,372 --> 00:07:32,001
You said you'd go across the hall
and look. Do you do that every year?

119
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:33,241
Yeah.

120
00:07:33,492 --> 00:07:36,052
You don't go into the back
of my closet. . .

121
00:07:36,292 --> 00:07:38,567
. . .and look under my gym bag
or anything?

122
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:41,650
-No. Never do that.
-No.

123
00:07:44,572 --> 00:07:47,644
That's where Joey gave me stuff
to store that I've never seen.

124
00:07:50,212 --> 00:07:52,203
Okay, that did not just happen.

125
00:08:00,092 --> 00:08:01,047
Here comes a camera.

126
00:08:01,292 --> 00:08:04,204
Right. No biggie. Stay loose.

127
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:15,443
Why do they keep doing that?

128
00:08:15,692 --> 00:08:18,411
We have to get up on one
of those platforms.

129
00:08:18,652 --> 00:08:20,290
They've been taping them all day.

130
00:08:20,532 --> 00:08:21,601
Right.

131
00:08:26,292 --> 00:08:28,522
What'd you guys do
to get up on there?

132
00:08:28,772 --> 00:08:30,251
We learned how to dance.

133
00:08:31,692 --> 00:08:35,048
When you learned to dance, did you
forget how to put on underpants?

134
00:08:35,292 --> 00:08:36,088
Yeah!

135
00:08:40,292 --> 00:08:43,125
-Hey, you're a good dancer.
-Really?

136
00:08:43,372 --> 00:08:45,442
You'd be better if you
loosened your hips.

137
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:48,206
-What do you mean?
-Like this.

138
00:08:49,972 --> 00:08:53,567
That's it. Feel the rhythm.
That's better.

139
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,805
You're dancing with her.

140
00:08:58,052 --> 00:09:00,441
-We're together.
-Yeah, we came together.

141
00:09:01,252 --> 00:09:02,605
I don't see it.

142
00:09:03,492 --> 00:09:06,802
You are dancing with the tall guy.
Tall Guy, raise your hand!

143
00:09:07,892 --> 00:09:12,329
Hey, buddy. Let me dance with her.
I like her and I think I have a shot.

144
00:09:12,572 --> 00:09:14,608
Really, you think so? I don't.

145
00:09:31,692 --> 00:09:34,126
I couldn't find anything--
Hey, wait!

146
00:09:34,372 --> 00:09:35,441
Yeah, we found them.

147
00:09:35,692 --> 00:09:37,648
They were in the guest room closet.

148
00:09:37,892 --> 00:09:40,850
You have nothing to worry about
because they're crap.

149
00:09:43,572 --> 00:09:45,528
Those are mine.
I got those for you.

150
00:09:48,572 --> 00:09:50,961
Oh. Thanks, Chandler, they're great!

151
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:56,243
Chandler, what is this very weird
metal A-Z thing?

152
00:09:56,492 --> 00:09:59,529
Those are bookends.
That's a great gift.

153
00:09:59,772 --> 00:10:02,809
Oh. Okay, I'm sorry.
Thank you for my "az. "

154
00:10:05,452 --> 00:10:08,250
Make sure you put all that stuff
back in the closet.

155
00:10:08,492 --> 00:10:09,686
Yes, okay.

156
00:10:09,932 --> 00:10:14,244
By the way, I think it's really nice
of you that even after you moved. . .

157
00:10:14,492 --> 00:10:17,131
. . .you still keep storing
that stuff for Joey.

158
00:10:32,892 --> 00:10:34,007
Hey, dancing girl?

159
00:10:35,572 --> 00:10:37,403
Can I go to the bathroom?

160
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,403
Here we go. Yeah.

161
00:10:46,492 --> 00:10:47,845
Looking good, Gellers!

162
00:10:49,012 --> 00:10:50,411
We know!

163
00:10:52,092 --> 00:10:55,528
That snippy guy's the one who
decides who gets on the platform.

164
00:10:55,772 --> 00:10:57,410
-We should go dance by him.
-Okay.

165
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:07,010
Okay, everybody, hold!

166
00:11:08,772 --> 00:11:11,411
Next on the platforms are. . . .

167
00:11:15,292 --> 00:11:17,886
You two! And. . . .

168
00:11:20,092 --> 00:11:21,650
-You two!
-Cool!

169
00:11:21,892 --> 00:11:23,405
Excuse me? Sir?

170
00:11:23,652 --> 00:11:26,212
Would it help if I weren't
wearing underpants?

171
00:11:27,092 --> 00:11:28,081
Would it?

172
00:11:35,012 --> 00:11:37,606
Hey, Tall Guy!

173
00:11:38,852 --> 00:11:41,810
I want to talk to you about that girl
you're dancing with.

174
00:11:42,012 --> 00:11:45,607
She's nice, huh? To think I almost
brought my wife to this.

175
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:49,125
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

176
00:11:51,892 --> 00:11:54,042
Look, I came with that girl, okay?

177
00:11:54,292 --> 00:11:56,852
I plan to kiss her
at the New Year's countdown.

178
00:11:57,092 --> 00:11:58,730
I'm trying to win her over. I--

179
00:11:58,972 --> 00:12:00,405
I don't think so.

180
00:12:00,692 --> 00:12:02,410
You can dance with my partner.

181
00:12:02,652 --> 00:12:04,608
She's real mellow.

182
00:12:05,852 --> 00:12:09,242
Look, you dating this girl
you came with?

183
00:12:09,492 --> 00:12:11,847
I was hoping after tonight
that maybe. . . .

184
00:12:12,092 --> 00:12:15,209
No. No. She's fair game
if you ask me. Sorry, buddy.

185
00:12:15,612 --> 00:12:16,806
All right. Hey.

186
00:12:17,212 --> 00:12:21,205
Fair is fair. When you're right,
you're right. What can I say?

187
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:26,931
Are you in second grade?

188
00:12:27,252 --> 00:12:29,812
Hey, man. You're the one
who wet his pants.

189
00:12:37,492 --> 00:12:38,686
Man, this sucks.

190
00:12:38,932 --> 00:12:42,049
If Mom and Dad don't see us
on TV after we made them jealous. . .

191
00:12:42,292 --> 00:12:44,408
. . .then who's gonna be
the losers then?

192
00:12:46,052 --> 00:12:48,771
I know what'll get us up
on a platform.

193
00:12:48,972 --> 00:12:49,768
What?

194
00:12:50,492 --> 00:12:51,971
The routine!

195
00:12:53,492 --> 00:12:56,211
We haven't done the routine
since middle school.

196
00:12:56,452 --> 00:12:58,727
When the snippy guy
sees the routine. . .

197
00:12:58,972 --> 00:13:01,327
. . .he'll want to build us
our own platform.

198
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,766
Was it that good?

199
00:13:03,012 --> 00:13:06,925
We got honorable mention in the
brother/sister dance category!

200
00:13:07,172 --> 00:13:10,528
It's almost fake midnight.
Do we really have any other choice?

201
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:13,810
Okay, let's do it.

202
00:13:14,292 --> 00:13:17,204
Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!

203
00:13:23,452 --> 00:13:25,443
Five, six, seven, eight!

204
00:14:05,572 --> 00:14:09,884
So, do we really need to ask who's
going up on the platform next?

205
00:14:10,172 --> 00:14:12,970
You get up there and do that
again, exactly like that.

206
00:14:16,652 --> 00:14:19,610
Get this. Dick will want
it for the Bloopers show.

207
00:14:20,612 --> 00:14:23,206
All right, cut!
Listen up, everyone!

208
00:14:23,412 --> 00:14:25,482
When we start,
it'll be the countdown. . .

209
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:28,610
. . .so I want to see
everybody's excitement!

210
00:14:28,972 --> 00:14:30,121
Hey, guy!

211
00:14:30,372 --> 00:14:32,283
You got three seconds to get away.

212
00:14:32,532 --> 00:14:33,806
What's going on here?

213
00:14:34,052 --> 00:14:36,088
Take a look at the guy's pants!

214
00:14:36,852 --> 00:14:40,686
You told us to show excitement,
but don't you think he went overboard?

215
00:14:42,212 --> 00:14:43,804
What's the matter with you? Go!

216
00:14:44,012 --> 00:14:45,968
Yeah, take a hike, wet pants!

217
00:14:48,492 --> 00:14:49,720
Can you believe this?

218
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,008
We're on the platform
for the millennial moment!

219
00:14:52,212 --> 00:14:53,042
I know!

220
00:14:53,812 --> 00:14:56,531
You haven't been practicing
the routine, have you?

221
00:14:56,892 --> 00:14:58,405
No.

222
00:14:59,612 --> 00:15:01,011
Me too!

223
00:15:01,892 --> 00:15:03,245
When the music starts. . .

224
00:15:03,492 --> 00:15:06,404
. . .I was thinking about maybe
going into the robot.

225
00:15:09,412 --> 00:15:13,041
Ross? We should stick to the routine.
We don't want to look stupid.

226
00:15:15,052 --> 00:15:17,566
All right, we're back!
Ten seconds left.

227
00:15:17,812 --> 00:15:20,770
-Ten.
-Nine, eight.

228
00:15:20,972 --> 00:15:21,768
Seven.

229
00:15:22,012 --> 00:15:24,242
Okay, it all comes down to this.

230
00:15:24,492 --> 00:15:27,404
Whatever happens, happens.

231
00:15:27,852 --> 00:15:29,604
Destiny.

232
00:15:29,812 --> 00:15:32,724
--three, two, one!

233
00:15:32,972 --> 00:15:34,644
-Cut!
-No!

234
00:15:36,772 --> 00:15:38,444
--year!

235
00:15:38,692 --> 00:15:41,206
Happy No Year!

236
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:46,207
Now we go to the live shot
of Times Square. That's a wrap!

237
00:15:58,692 --> 00:15:59,807
Hey, look who I found.

238
00:16:00,052 --> 00:16:01,405
Oh, hi, guys!

239
00:16:02,092 --> 00:16:04,401
Birds have a very good
sense of direction.

240
00:16:04,652 --> 00:16:07,405
I thought maybe they could help us
find the presents.

241
00:16:08,452 --> 00:16:11,808
Yes, if the presents are hidden
south for the winter.

242
00:16:12,252 --> 00:16:16,291
Or we could just follow your clever
jokes. Any ideas? Didn't think so.

243
00:16:17,972 --> 00:16:20,361
Come on, show us where
the presents are.

244
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:23,445
The duck seems to think that
Monica got me garbage.

245
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:27,207
I wonder what I could get Monica
that's as good as garbage.

246
00:16:28,052 --> 00:16:29,690
How about my "az"?

247
00:16:34,172 --> 00:16:36,732
Hey. This is hollow.

248
00:16:36,932 --> 00:16:37,728
What?

249
00:16:37,972 --> 00:16:41,601
This bench, it's hollow.
I can't believe I never knew that!

250
00:16:43,292 --> 00:16:46,329
-Oh, the presents!
-Don't look directly at them!

251
00:16:48,252 --> 00:16:49,241
What?

252
00:16:49,492 --> 00:16:51,801
All right, no, we could look at them.

253
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:53,411
This one's for me!

254
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,807
This one's for Chandler. Here.

255
00:16:56,012 --> 00:16:59,402
-And the big one's for me!
-Oh, let's open them!

256
00:17:00,572 --> 00:17:03,609
-Wait a minute. We can't do this.
-Why?

257
00:17:03,852 --> 00:17:07,003
I don't want to know
what Monica got me.

258
00:17:07,212 --> 00:17:10,807
I'm sure she worked hard at getting it
and wanting to surprise me.

259
00:17:11,012 --> 00:17:12,923
And you guys are gonna ruin that.

260
00:17:13,172 --> 00:17:16,369
We have to put them back.
This isn't what Christmas is about.

261
00:17:17,772 --> 00:17:19,683
Whatever, Linus.
I'm opening mine.

262
00:17:22,492 --> 00:17:25,609
Nobody is opening anything, okay?

263
00:17:25,892 --> 00:17:29,441
I want to see the look on her face
when I give her my present.

264
00:17:29,692 --> 00:17:33,048
I'm sure she wants to see the look
on my face when I get mine.

265
00:17:33,292 --> 00:17:36,921
So, please, please, can we just. . .?
Can we put them back?

266
00:17:37,892 --> 00:17:40,201
-Will you get us better gifts?
-Fine.

267
00:17:42,492 --> 00:17:43,811
Hey, guys.

268
00:17:45,892 --> 00:17:47,371
You found the presents?

269
00:17:47,852 --> 00:17:49,683
You let them find the presents?

270
00:17:49,932 --> 00:17:50,808
Great.

271
00:17:51,012 --> 00:17:54,800
Do you know how long it took me
to find you that water purifier?

272
00:17:55,692 --> 00:17:59,162
-That's what you got me?
-Yes, I see. That look is priceless.

273
00:18:05,492 --> 00:18:07,608
Home sweet home, huh?

274
00:18:08,412 --> 00:18:11,324
Nice to get back to reality.

275
00:18:13,012 --> 00:18:16,402
Plus, we know how the New Year's
gonna go off.

276
00:18:16,812 --> 00:18:20,043
I guess there's no reason for all
that Y2K panic, you know?

277
00:18:21,932 --> 00:18:23,604
Anyway, good night.

278
00:18:24,452 --> 00:18:26,010
-Joey?
-Yeah?

279
00:18:28,492 --> 00:18:29,811
Three. . .

280
00:18:30,252 --> 00:18:32,208
. . .two, one.

281
00:18:39,412 --> 00:18:40,765
Happy New Year.

282
00:18:45,412 --> 00:18:46,891
What was that for?

283
00:18:47,372 --> 00:18:50,409
Tonight when they yelled "cut"
and we didn't get to kiss. . .

284
00:18:50,612 --> 00:18:54,400
. . .I was really, really disappointed,
and I just. . . .

285
00:18:54,892 --> 00:18:56,803
I just really wanted to kiss you.

286
00:18:57,252 --> 00:18:58,605
Really?

287
00:19:00,012 --> 00:19:03,846
In the moment, I really wanted
to kiss you too. In the moment.

288
00:19:04,372 --> 00:19:06,647
-In the moment.
-But only in the moment.

289
00:19:08,692 --> 00:19:12,651
So do you want to kiss again?

290
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:16,410
Sure. New Year's Eve
is only two weeks away.

291
00:19:16,812 --> 00:19:17,801
Can you wait?

292
00:19:18,252 --> 00:19:19,605
No.

293
00:19:21,412 --> 00:19:22,561
Me neither.

294
00:19:25,572 --> 00:19:28,291
Three, two. . . .

295
00:19:28,532 --> 00:19:30,727
You don't have to count down
every time we kiss.

296
00:19:30,972 --> 00:19:32,803
Oh. Okay.

297
00:19:33,812 --> 00:19:38,602
Except I sort of felt like I needed
a couple seconds to get ready.

298
00:20:00,652 --> 00:20:04,008
We were on the platform, ready to
dance into the new millennium. . .

299
00:20:04,212 --> 00:20:06,806
. . .and the guy yells "cut! "

300
00:20:07,852 --> 00:20:10,650
So you guys are telling me
that you actually did. . .

301
00:20:10,892 --> 00:20:13,201
. . .the routine from eighth grade?

302
00:20:13,692 --> 00:20:17,128
Yeah! But of course we had
to update it a little bit.

303
00:20:17,372 --> 00:20:20,205
Hey, by the way, quick thinking
about catching me.

304
00:20:21,412 --> 00:20:23,926
There's no way you could've
done the end. . .

305
00:20:24,172 --> 00:20:26,447
. . .the way you guys did it back then.

306
00:20:27,372 --> 00:20:30,728
What? We could do it.

307
00:20:30,972 --> 00:20:35,727
I don't know. You were a lot bigger--
I mean, stronger back then.

308
00:20:37,572 --> 00:20:39,130
I can do it, okay?

309
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,802
Come on, let's go! Come on.

310
00:20:43,012 --> 00:20:44,650
One, two, three, four. . .
