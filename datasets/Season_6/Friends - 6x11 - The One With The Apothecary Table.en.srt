1
00:00:06,092 --> 00:00:07,241
Listen. . . .

2
00:00:07,492 --> 00:00:09,483
You think I have a chance with Janine?

3
00:00:10,092 --> 00:00:11,445
We've been through this.

4
00:00:11,652 --> 00:00:13,005
Don't do this to yourself.

5
00:00:13,252 --> 00:00:15,482
She made it clear it isn't
going to happen.

6
00:00:15,732 --> 00:00:19,042
All right, then. I guess I shouldn't
get too excited. . .

7
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:20,765
. . .that I just kissed her!

8
00:00:21,012 --> 00:00:23,082
-Are you serious?
-That's great!

9
00:00:23,652 --> 00:00:24,971
Yeah, well, we'll see.

10
00:00:27,052 --> 00:00:28,041
You kissed her?

11
00:00:28,452 --> 00:00:31,046
We kissed it up real nice.

12
00:00:31,812 --> 00:00:33,643
So you kissed. Then what happened?

13
00:00:34,132 --> 00:00:36,248
I came over here to tell you guys.

14
00:00:37,252 --> 00:00:39,163
So she's waiting over
there for you?

15
00:00:40,852 --> 00:00:41,841
Yeah.

16
00:00:46,652 --> 00:00:48,483
The One With The Apothecary Table

18
00:01:26,732 --> 00:01:28,768
-I gotta go.
-Okay.

19
00:01:31,332 --> 00:01:33,368
I'm gonna be late
for dance class.

20
00:01:33,572 --> 00:01:34,561
Okay.

21
00:01:36,932 --> 00:01:39,446
-Okay, now I'm really leaving.
-All right.

22
00:01:39,692 --> 00:01:40,761
But can you just. . .

23
00:01:41,012 --> 00:01:42,843
. . .just leave your lips?

24
00:01:49,332 --> 00:01:50,765
Have you kissed her yet?

25
00:01:52,652 --> 00:01:54,051
It's awesome!

26
00:01:54,252 --> 00:01:55,685
I could do it forever.

27
00:01:55,932 --> 00:02:00,403
You know what? She kisses better
than my mom cooks.

28
00:02:00,652 --> 00:02:03,246
I'm so glad you said "cooks. "

29
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:08,482
Rachel, you've got to tell
the post office that you've moved.

30
00:02:08,892 --> 00:02:10,769
We still get your bills and stuff.

31
00:02:11,692 --> 00:02:14,365
Pottery Barn!
You can throw the rest away.

32
00:02:15,172 --> 00:02:16,525
I'm not your garbage man.

33
00:02:17,692 --> 00:02:19,250
I'm your mailman.

34
00:02:20,652 --> 00:02:22,085
Monica, look.

35
00:02:22,332 --> 00:02:24,971
Here is that table that I ordered.

36
00:02:25,252 --> 00:02:29,245
-You got it from Pottery Barn?
-Yeah. It's an apothecary table.

37
00:02:29,492 --> 00:02:31,642
Does anyone even know what
an apothecary is?

38
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:32,728
A pharmacist.

39
00:02:34,652 --> 00:02:35,641
"A pharmacist. "

40
00:02:38,212 --> 00:02:40,043
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.

41
00:02:40,332 --> 00:02:41,765
I hate Pottery Barn too.

42
00:02:42,012 --> 00:02:44,970
They kicked me out just
because I sat on a bed.

43
00:02:45,212 --> 00:02:47,806
You took off your pants and
got under the sheets.

44
00:02:50,492 --> 00:02:51,641
I was tired.

45
00:02:53,812 --> 00:02:55,450
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?

46
00:02:55,652 --> 00:02:57,449
She hates mass-produced stuff.

47
00:02:57,692 --> 00:03:00,445
She thinks her furniture should
have a story behind it.

48
00:03:00,692 --> 00:03:02,569
This has a story behind it.

49
00:03:02,812 --> 00:03:06,851
They had to ship it all the way
from the White Plains store.

50
00:03:09,612 --> 00:03:11,648
It's got to be one-of-a-kind.

51
00:03:11,972 --> 00:03:15,726
Like that God-awful ceramic fruit
bowl she has on her counter?

52
00:03:15,932 --> 00:03:18,651
Hey! I made that for her.

53
00:03:20,132 --> 00:03:21,531
-You made pottery?
-Yeah.

54
00:03:21,732 --> 00:03:24,690
I made it out of a fruit bowl
I found in the garbage.

55
00:03:26,852 --> 00:03:30,288
If you put that in her apartment,
you'll never hear the end of it.

56
00:03:30,492 --> 00:03:32,642
I'll tell her that it's an antique.

57
00:03:32,892 --> 00:03:35,247
She doesn't have to know
where it came from.

58
00:03:35,892 --> 00:03:37,484
I love these little drawers.

59
00:03:37,732 --> 00:03:40,485
Oh, look! It says that
it holds 300 CDs.

60
00:03:40,732 --> 00:03:43,644
Just like the apothecary tables
of yore.

61
00:03:50,532 --> 00:03:51,647
So the farmer says:

62
00:03:51,892 --> 00:03:54,645
"That's not a cow,
and you're not milking. "

63
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:58,284
I'm so glad you're together.

64
00:03:58,532 --> 00:04:01,604
We wanted a couple to go out with
and now we have one.

65
00:04:01,932 --> 00:04:03,650
We're a couple of couples.

66
00:04:04,852 --> 00:04:07,685
I had so much fun tonight.
What a great restaurant!

67
00:04:07,932 --> 00:04:11,447
And Chandler, I can't believe
I let you pay for this one.

68
00:04:14,252 --> 00:04:15,321
Thanks again, man.

69
00:04:16,652 --> 00:04:19,485
If you come over tomorrow,
I'll make pasta.

70
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:21,045
-That'd be great!
-Okay.

71
00:04:21,692 --> 00:04:23,569
But at least let us
bring the wine.

72
00:04:23,812 --> 00:04:27,043
-You don't have to.
-I insist.

73
00:04:30,132 --> 00:04:32,043
-You'll get the wine, right?
-Yeah.

74
00:04:33,692 --> 00:04:35,887
-Okay, good night.
-See you tomorrow.

75
00:04:36,212 --> 00:04:37,406
Can't wait.

76
00:04:42,132 --> 00:04:44,646
How are we going to get
out of that one?

77
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:52,011
I can't handle two
nights in a row with them.

78
00:04:53,652 --> 00:04:55,085
What's wrong with them?

79
00:04:55,332 --> 00:04:56,970
They're just a little. . .

80
00:04:57,212 --> 00:04:58,406
. . .blah!

81
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:00,926
Blah?

82
00:05:01,692 --> 00:05:05,002
Well, you know, he's blah.
She's just. . . .

83
00:05:05,292 --> 00:05:07,886
She's very loud for such
a small person.

84
00:05:12,092 --> 00:05:13,366
They're my best friends.

85
00:05:13,612 --> 00:05:17,002
Are you saying we can't go out?
'Cause that'd be a problem.

86
00:05:17,412 --> 00:05:19,880
Of course we can still
hang out with them.

87
00:05:20,132 --> 00:05:22,009
Just not two nights in a row.

88
00:05:23,812 --> 00:05:26,804
-Okay?
-I guess.

89
00:05:27,012 --> 00:05:28,445
Thank you.

90
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:35,647
I'll sell my friends and use
the money to buy you presents.

91
00:05:43,612 --> 00:05:47,400
What a great table!
Where did you get it?

92
00:05:47,892 --> 00:05:49,245
Guess.

93
00:05:50,732 --> 00:05:51,960
A flea market?

94
00:05:52,532 --> 00:05:55,000
I knew you would get it
on the first guess.

95
00:05:56,492 --> 00:05:59,848
Isn't it cool?
It's an apothecary table.

96
00:06:01,012 --> 00:06:03,526
You can just imagine
that this is where. . .

97
00:06:03,772 --> 00:06:06,240
. . .they kept all their stuff
to make potions.

98
00:06:08,212 --> 00:06:10,248
You can almost smell the opium.

99
00:06:12,452 --> 00:06:13,487
Almost.

100
00:06:13,932 --> 00:06:14,967
How much was it?

101
00:06:15,212 --> 00:06:16,691
Just only 500 bucks.

102
00:06:16,892 --> 00:06:18,484
500 bucks at a flea market?

103
00:06:19,252 --> 00:06:22,050
I thought you meant how much was it. . .

104
00:06:22,292 --> 00:06:24,169
. . .when it was new, back then.

105
00:06:25,692 --> 00:06:28,650
It was at a flea market,
so it was like a dollar.

106
00:06:30,492 --> 00:06:33,052
-A dollar?
-And fifty?

107
00:06:33,332 --> 00:06:35,846
So it was like
one and fifty dollars.

108
00:06:36,892 --> 00:06:39,850
-They gave you the old-time pricing.
-Yeah.

109
00:06:40,932 --> 00:06:42,524
Well, what period is it from?

110
00:06:43,052 --> 00:06:44,280
It's from yore.

111
00:06:44,532 --> 00:06:46,568
Like, the "days of yore," you know?

112
00:06:47,852 --> 00:06:48,887
Yes, I do.

113
00:06:49,132 --> 00:06:52,169
-It's just perfect.
-Oh, good.

114
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,403
I bet it has a great story too.

115
00:06:54,612 --> 00:06:56,648
Did they tell you
where it's from or. . . .

116
00:06:56,892 --> 00:07:00,248
Yes, that I know.
This is from White Plains.

117
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:03,040
White Plains.

118
00:07:03,252 --> 00:07:06,050
It sounds like such a magical place.

119
00:07:11,332 --> 00:07:12,845
-I'm here.
-Hi!

120
00:07:14,132 --> 00:07:15,281
Oh, my God!

121
00:07:15,532 --> 00:07:17,170
-You like it?
-Oh, my God!

122
00:07:17,412 --> 00:07:19,926
It's my new apothecary table!

123
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:23,200
Phoebe'll be here any second.
She can't see this.

124
00:07:23,452 --> 00:07:26,046
Why not? She'll love it.
It's the real thing.

125
00:07:26,252 --> 00:07:27,890
I got it at Pottery Barn.

126
00:07:28,932 --> 00:07:30,843
I know. I bought the same one.

127
00:07:31,052 --> 00:07:33,646
And if she sees your table,
she'll know I lied.

128
00:07:33,852 --> 00:07:36,412
-I said ours was an original.
-Why?

129
00:07:36,612 --> 00:07:38,489
Because she hates Pottery Barn.

130
00:07:38,732 --> 00:07:41,929
She hates Pottery Barn?

131
00:07:42,732 --> 00:07:44,688
She says it's all mass-produced. . .

132
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:48,641
. . .nothing is authentic, and everyone
winds up having the same stuff.

133
00:07:51,332 --> 00:07:54,290
So come on!
Can we cover this up, please?

134
00:07:55,492 --> 00:07:57,562
I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe.

135
00:07:57,772 --> 00:08:00,889
Although I did get some great
Pottery Barn sheets.

136
00:08:02,132 --> 00:08:04,248
I forgot they made sheets!

137
00:08:08,052 --> 00:08:10,885
I still can't believe
she hates Pottery Barn.

138
00:08:11,212 --> 00:08:12,691
It's not like she hates you.

139
00:08:12,932 --> 00:08:14,843
Yeah, but Pottery Barn?

140
00:08:17,732 --> 00:08:19,962
You know what I think?
She's just weird.

141
00:08:20,492 --> 00:08:23,404
It's because she's a twin.
Twins are weird.

142
00:08:24,452 --> 00:08:27,922
She's not weird. She likes
her stuff to be one-of-a-kind.

143
00:08:29,252 --> 00:08:32,483
You know what's not one-of-a-kind?
A twin!

144
00:08:37,132 --> 00:08:39,726
Let's turn out the lights
and watch the movie.

145
00:08:40,932 --> 00:08:43,400
-Hey, cool sheet!
-You like it?

146
00:08:43,652 --> 00:08:46,246
-You want to know where I got it?
-Sure.

147
00:08:46,452 --> 00:08:47,805
At a flea market.

148
00:08:49,332 --> 00:08:51,562
You buy your sheets
at a flea market?

149
00:08:52,612 --> 00:08:55,649
Come on, you gotta loosen the
purse strings a little.

150
00:08:59,132 --> 00:09:01,487
Dinner will be ready in 20 minutes.

151
00:09:01,732 --> 00:09:04,200
Here is the wine to bring
over tonight.

152
00:09:05,452 --> 00:09:07,568
You were also gonna
buy Monica flowers. . .

153
00:09:07,812 --> 00:09:11,043
. . .but you couldn't because
you paid for dinner last night.

154
00:09:11,932 --> 00:09:14,924
Thanks. But it's just
gonna be me tonight.

155
00:09:15,212 --> 00:09:18,841
-What happened to Janine?
-She's really sick.

156
00:09:19,332 --> 00:09:22,051
-That's too bad.
-Yeah, she's been in there all day.

157
00:09:22,252 --> 00:09:25,767
High fever, nose problem.
It's. . .

158
00:09:25,972 --> 00:09:28,202
. . .phlegm, phlegm,
phlegm, phlegm, phlegm.

159
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:32,445
Monica! Chandler!

160
00:09:34,452 --> 00:09:37,842
I'm sorry about tonight. I don't
know if Joey told you. . .

161
00:09:38,052 --> 00:09:41,010
. . .but I couldn't get out
of going to this play.

162
00:09:43,492 --> 00:09:45,847
Have a great time, huh?

163
00:09:49,532 --> 00:09:51,568
That's funny, I saw no phlegm.

164
00:09:56,812 --> 00:09:58,245
Oh, no, she really is sick.

165
00:09:58,492 --> 00:10:00,289
Then why is she going to a play?

166
00:10:00,492 --> 00:10:02,767
Well, you know, "Starve a fever. . .

167
00:10:03,012 --> 00:10:04,764
. . .go to a play for a cold. "

168
00:10:06,332 --> 00:10:09,563
Why is Janine not coming
over for dinner?

169
00:10:09,812 --> 00:10:13,725
She didn't want to hang out with
you guys two nights in a row.

170
00:10:13,972 --> 00:10:15,041
I'm so sorry.

171
00:10:15,932 --> 00:10:18,048
Why doesn't she want
to hang out with us?

172
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:23,122
Because she thinks that
you are "blah. "

173
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,760
And that you, Monica,
are too loud.

174
00:10:27,972 --> 00:10:29,451
What?!

175
00:10:30,852 --> 00:10:32,968
What?

176
00:10:33,212 --> 00:10:35,248
So she just pretended to
have a good time?

177
00:10:35,452 --> 00:10:37,283
She was lying to our faces?

178
00:10:37,532 --> 00:10:39,682
I can't believe this.
Who is she to judge us?

179
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:44,130
-We couldn't have been nicer to her.
-And I am not "blah. " I am a hoot!

180
00:10:45,532 --> 00:10:47,841
Come on, please, you guys.
Don't be mad.

181
00:10:48,052 --> 00:10:49,644
I'm sure she said it. . .

182
00:10:49,852 --> 00:10:53,049
. . .because she was nervous 'cause
you're my best friends.

183
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:55,163
And it was our first date.

184
00:10:55,412 --> 00:10:58,085
Plus, she's really sick.

185
00:11:00,132 --> 00:11:02,009
You said you made that up!

186
00:11:02,212 --> 00:11:05,010
But isn't the "sick" thing
better than the "play" thing?

187
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:09,966
They're both good. I generally just
go with, "Monica's drunk again. "

188
00:11:11,492 --> 00:11:14,564
Come on, please just
give her another chance.

189
00:11:14,812 --> 00:11:18,088
-She'll come around, I promise.
-Of course we will.

190
00:11:18,332 --> 00:11:20,846
-Come on, we gotta make dinner.
-Okay.

191
00:11:25,212 --> 00:11:26,645
I do not like that woman!

192
00:11:27,132 --> 00:11:29,043
I can hear you!

193
00:11:30,332 --> 00:11:32,163
I am loud!

194
00:11:42,412 --> 00:11:45,449
Can you please not put your
feet up on my new. . .

195
00:11:45,932 --> 00:11:47,445
. . .old sheet.

196
00:11:48,012 --> 00:11:49,001
Oh, sure.

197
00:11:50,332 --> 00:11:52,368
My apothecary table!

198
00:11:53,052 --> 00:11:55,043
-What?
-No!

199
00:11:55,892 --> 00:11:58,884
-Where did you get this?
-At Pottery Barn, okay?

200
00:12:01,412 --> 00:12:03,164
Oh, my God!

201
00:12:03,532 --> 00:12:07,571
Pottery Barn has ripped off
the design of our antique!

202
00:12:09,532 --> 00:12:11,966
If they've ripped off our table. . .

203
00:12:12,212 --> 00:12:15,841
. . .ours must be worth much more
than one and fifty dollars.

204
00:12:17,012 --> 00:12:19,287
This doesn't even
smell like opium.

205
00:12:19,532 --> 00:12:22,285
It smells like wine,
which you spilled.

206
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,369
And thanks for wrecking my sheet.

207
00:12:24,812 --> 00:12:28,441
Ross, calm down. I'll give
you the 80 cents.

208
00:12:33,532 --> 00:12:35,090
Okay, one more time.

209
00:12:35,332 --> 00:12:37,050
Would you like some orange juice?

210
00:12:37,252 --> 00:12:40,528
-Perfect decibel.
-I know!

211
00:12:44,012 --> 00:12:45,764
What are you guys doing?

212
00:12:46,012 --> 00:12:49,402
Nothing. We're just talking.
You know, blah-blah-blah.

213
00:12:50,692 --> 00:12:53,126
Come on, you said you were gonna try.

214
00:12:53,332 --> 00:12:56,847
I came over to invite you to
a movie with me and Janine.

215
00:12:57,052 --> 00:12:58,644
-What do you say?
-I'd like to. . .

216
00:12:58,852 --> 00:13:00,843
. . .but I'm not sure if
we have the time.

217
00:13:02,132 --> 00:13:04,441
Very funny. I don't know
what to do.

218
00:13:04,692 --> 00:13:06,569
I really want you to get along.

219
00:13:06,812 --> 00:13:09,326
Please, come to the movie with us.
You owe me.

220
00:13:09,732 --> 00:13:11,165
-We owe you?
-That's right.

221
00:13:11,372 --> 00:13:14,250
I helped you out in the
start of your relationship.

222
00:13:14,452 --> 00:13:16,488
I helped you sneak around
for six months.

223
00:13:16,852 --> 00:13:18,444
I looked like an idiot.

224
00:13:18,652 --> 00:13:20,085
And I was humiliated.

225
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:21,924
And I only made $200.

226
00:13:24,052 --> 00:13:26,247
We didn't give you any money.

227
00:13:29,372 --> 00:13:31,090
You don't think I know that?

228
00:13:35,332 --> 00:13:38,290
I can't decide if it goes
better by the new chair. . .

229
00:13:38,612 --> 00:13:39,681
. . .the Sahara desk. . .

230
00:13:39,932 --> 00:13:41,888
. . .or the Parker console table.

231
00:13:42,092 --> 00:13:44,447
I didn't know there was
a Pottery Barn up here.

232
00:13:45,852 --> 00:13:47,968
-I know, I went a little crazy.
-A little?

233
00:13:48,172 --> 00:13:50,891
Your place looks like page 72
of the catalog.

234
00:13:52,212 --> 00:13:53,486
Look at that!

235
00:13:53,692 --> 00:13:57,651
The ornamental birdcage!
Large.

236
00:14:00,332 --> 00:14:03,244
Oh, Ross? Be careful.
That is very old.

237
00:14:03,492 --> 00:14:07,565
Colonial bird merchants used to
bring their birds to market in that.

238
00:14:09,012 --> 00:14:10,047
Fascinating.

239
00:14:12,332 --> 00:14:14,482
Another amazing find!

240
00:14:16,212 --> 00:14:18,965
-I bet this has a great story too.
-It does.

241
00:14:19,212 --> 00:14:23,603
It is a room-separating apparatus
from Colonial times.

242
00:14:25,452 --> 00:14:28,444
A lot of this stuff is from
the Colonial times.

243
00:14:28,652 --> 00:14:31,371
What are some other
time periods, Rachel?

244
00:14:34,012 --> 00:14:35,286
Well, there's yore.

245
00:14:37,932 --> 00:14:40,400
And, you know, yesteryear.

246
00:14:42,892 --> 00:14:45,850
Rachel has such a
good eye for this stuff.

247
00:14:46,092 --> 00:14:48,367
Ross, if you ever decide
to redecorate--

248
00:14:48,612 --> 00:14:50,682
--and I think you should--

249
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:52,650
--you should ask Rachel to help.

250
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,450
He doesn't need my help.

251
00:14:54,652 --> 00:14:57,849
I think he's ready to get rid
of the-- What'd you call it?

252
00:14:58,092 --> 00:15:00,731
The "cheap knockoffs
and dinosaur junk"?

253
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:05,442
Really?

254
00:15:07,412 --> 00:15:11,246
You know, since you have such a
great sense of what I need--

255
00:15:11,492 --> 00:15:13,448
Here's 60 bucks.

256
00:15:13,652 --> 00:15:17,645
Why don't you take Phoebe down
to that Colonial flea market. . .

257
00:15:17,892 --> 00:15:19,530
. . .and get me some stuff?

258
00:15:23,812 --> 00:15:25,882
I don't think Phoebe wants to come.

259
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,730
-I do want to.
-She does want to.

260
00:15:27,932 --> 00:15:29,684
-She does want to.
-Yeah!

261
00:15:35,692 --> 00:15:39,082
I guess the flea market was
just better last time.

262
00:15:39,332 --> 00:15:42,244
Well, at least I got these
sheets for Ross.

263
00:15:43,452 --> 00:15:46,649
Ugh, look at this. Pottery Barn.

264
00:15:46,932 --> 00:15:49,492
You know what? Don't look at it.

265
00:15:49,732 --> 00:15:52,041
-Seriously, don't look at it.
-Look!

266
00:15:52,292 --> 00:15:54,169
There's the table
they stole from us.

267
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,323
Oh, those bastards! Let's go.

268
00:15:57,932 --> 00:16:02,244
That fan kind of looks like ours,
and the birdcage, and. . . .

269
00:16:02,732 --> 00:16:05,405
Wait a second, this is our
exact living room!

270
00:16:05,612 --> 00:16:07,682
No, it's not.

271
00:16:07,932 --> 00:16:10,162
Come on, ours is totally different.

272
00:16:10,412 --> 00:16:13,882
I mean, we don't have the--
We don't have that lamp.

273
00:16:14,732 --> 00:16:18,850
And that screen is on
the other side.

274
00:16:19,852 --> 00:16:22,889
Oh, my God. This is where you
got all our stuff.

275
00:16:23,132 --> 00:16:25,441
Pottery Barn! Oh, my God!

276
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:28,441
Okay, I did, all right?
I'm sorry.

277
00:16:28,692 --> 00:16:32,571
I wanted this stuff and I know
how you feel about Pottery Barn.

278
00:16:32,812 --> 00:16:35,485
-Come on, don't be mad.
-No, but I am mad.

279
00:16:35,732 --> 00:16:38,929
Because this stuff is what's
wrong with the world. . .

280
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:41,043
. . .and it's in my living room. . .

281
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:44,841
. . .and all I can think about is
how I don't have that lamp!

282
00:16:46,252 --> 00:16:48,049
Well, then, honey, buy the lamp.

283
00:16:48,252 --> 00:16:50,368
We have that 60 bucks from Ross.

284
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:54,646
I can't! I can't!

285
00:16:55,132 --> 00:16:56,645
Unless. . . .

286
00:16:56,852 --> 00:17:00,322
Are you saying you'd move out
if I didn't buy that lamp?

287
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:02,529
No, I'm not gonna move out!

288
00:17:02,732 --> 00:17:06,645
But are you saying that you would
move out if I didn't buy that lamp?

289
00:17:07,532 --> 00:17:11,241
-Yes! I would so move out.
-Then I don't have a choice.

290
00:17:11,452 --> 00:17:14,046
-I have to buy that lamp!
-That's right.

291
00:17:15,132 --> 00:17:18,090
But at least the apothecary
table's real.

292
00:17:22,932 --> 00:17:26,083
This was great.
Didn't everybody have a great time?

293
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:28,926
I did. I really did.
And I've got to say. . .

294
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:32,363
. . .I'm sorry if I was weird after
the last time we went out.

295
00:17:32,572 --> 00:17:34,369
I guess I was just nervous.

296
00:17:34,612 --> 00:17:37,126
-That's understandable.
-Don't worry about it.

297
00:17:37,332 --> 00:17:38,481
So we can go out again?

298
00:17:39,132 --> 00:17:40,884
-Absolutely.
-Well, good.

299
00:17:47,212 --> 00:17:48,486
See?

300
00:17:48,812 --> 00:17:49,801
Wasn't that fun?

301
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:51,849
We have got to move.

302
00:17:52,732 --> 00:17:54,006
What?

303
00:17:54,292 --> 00:17:55,407
I knew it!

304
00:17:57,252 --> 00:17:59,482
You're not so quiet yourself, missy!

305
00:18:01,332 --> 00:18:04,244
I'm blah? The only thing more
boring than modern dance. . .

306
00:18:04,452 --> 00:18:05,680
. . .is you talking about it.

307
00:18:05,932 --> 00:18:09,242
"Oh, Chandler, I just lost
myself in the movement. "

308
00:18:12,532 --> 00:18:14,648
You know, I know you're talking. . .

309
00:18:14,852 --> 00:18:17,446
. . .but all I hear is
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.

310
00:18:17,692 --> 00:18:20,729
All right, you and me!
Let's go, right now!

311
00:18:21,012 --> 00:18:22,161
All right, enough!

312
00:18:23,132 --> 00:18:26,249
Enough! You two, go home.
I gotta talk to Janine.

313
00:18:26,612 --> 00:18:28,648
I really think you could take her.

314
00:18:29,452 --> 00:18:32,125
You better hope I don't
see you in the hallway!

315
00:18:36,732 --> 00:18:37,721
All right.

316
00:18:38,412 --> 00:18:41,085
Look, we got a little bit
of a problem here.

317
00:18:41,332 --> 00:18:43,448
You can't my treat
my friends that way.

318
00:18:43,652 --> 00:18:47,565
-They said stuff to me too.
-I know, I'll talk to them about it.

319
00:18:48,412 --> 00:18:49,891
They mean so much to me.

320
00:18:50,132 --> 00:18:52,282
They're like my family, you know?

321
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:55,604
If you guys are gonna be
fighting all the time. . . .

322
00:18:56,892 --> 00:19:00,441
I don't think we can be together.
It just can't work, okay?

323
00:19:00,652 --> 00:19:01,926
It can't.

324
00:19:02,172 --> 00:19:03,969
I'm very upset.

325
00:19:05,332 --> 00:19:06,765
Okay.

326
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:09,082
Would it help if I apologized?

327
00:19:09,652 --> 00:19:10,880
Yeah.

328
00:19:11,132 --> 00:19:12,804
That'd be very helpful.

329
00:19:17,652 --> 00:19:20,120
What did I tell you about the hall?

330
00:19:22,252 --> 00:19:24,971
I was coming over to
apologize for my behavior.

331
00:19:26,452 --> 00:19:29,046
I'd really like it if we
could be friends.

332
00:19:31,652 --> 00:19:35,770
Well, I know that would
make Joey happy, so. . .

333
00:19:36,012 --> 00:19:38,048
. . .I would like that too.

334
00:19:38,892 --> 00:19:40,769
-Great.
-Now, come on.

335
00:19:44,412 --> 00:19:46,642
-I'm glad we worked it out.
-Me too.

336
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,649
-I'll see you.
-Bye.

337
00:19:48,892 --> 00:19:51,804
-Or I'll hear you.
-That's it, big girl!

338
00:19:53,772 --> 00:19:54,568
Wait!

339
00:19:58,892 --> 00:20:00,325
You'd better run!

340
00:20:01,852 --> 00:20:03,046
Did you hear that?

341
00:20:04,852 --> 00:20:07,286
-What am I gonna do?
-I'm sorry, man.

342
00:20:09,452 --> 00:20:11,010
-Want to go watch?
-Yeah!

343
00:20:20,612 --> 00:20:23,285
-How you doing?
-So did she move out?

344
00:20:23,652 --> 00:20:25,165
Pretty much.

345
00:20:25,412 --> 00:20:27,607
I can't believe you just
broke up with her.

346
00:20:27,812 --> 00:20:29,803
When it's not right, you know it.

347
00:20:30,132 --> 00:20:33,090
-You okay?
-I'll be all right.

348
00:20:34,732 --> 00:20:37,246
-You know what'd cheer you up?
-What?

349
00:20:37,852 --> 00:20:41,925
I'm giving this lecture on
erosion theories tomorrow night.

350
00:20:43,612 --> 00:20:45,204
I think you should come.

351
00:20:51,892 --> 00:20:53,883
You're right, that did cheer me up.
