1
00:00:03,372 --> 00:00:05,488
Hey! You're not gonna believe this.

2
00:00:05,732 --> 00:00:08,371
I made up a joke
and sent it in to Playboy.

3
00:00:08,612 --> 00:00:10,091
They printed it.

4
00:00:12,372 --> 00:00:14,249
I didn't know they print jokes.

5
00:00:14,452 --> 00:00:17,125
They print jokes, interviews,
hard-hitting journalism.

6
00:00:17,372 --> 00:00:19,090
It's not just about the pictures.

7
00:00:19,292 --> 00:00:21,681
Didn't work on Mom,
it's not gonna work on us.

8
00:00:22,692 --> 00:00:24,842
Check it out. It's the first one.

9
00:00:26,252 --> 00:00:27,480
Right there.

10
00:00:30,012 --> 00:00:31,206
That is funny.

11
00:00:31,452 --> 00:00:33,443
It was also funny when I made it up.

12
00:00:35,572 --> 00:00:37,449
-What?
-I made that joke up.

13
00:00:37,652 --> 00:00:39,404
No, you didn't. I did.

14
00:00:39,652 --> 00:00:43,964
Yes, I did. I told Dan and he said it
was the funniest he'd joke ever heard.

15
00:00:44,212 --> 00:00:46,123
Hey, tell Dan thanks.

16
00:00:50,412 --> 00:00:51,401
What?

17
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:55,201
I was just reading the joke below it.
Man, that one is funny.

18
00:00:57,532 --> 00:01:00,683
Monica, you remember me
telling you that joke, right?

19
00:01:01,092 --> 00:01:02,650
-No.
-Seriously?

20
00:01:03,092 --> 00:01:04,844
You tell a lot of jokes.

21
00:01:06,612 --> 00:01:07,727
Look, it's my joke.

22
00:01:07,972 --> 00:01:11,203
But if it makes you feel better,
they don't print the name.

23
00:01:11,452 --> 00:01:13,807
So it doesn't really matter
who gets credit.

24
00:01:14,012 --> 00:01:14,922
Yeah, I guess.

25
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,767
-Hey, guys.
-Playboy printed my joke!

26
00:01:17,972 --> 00:01:20,691
No, it's mine! Call them!
They'll tell you!

27
00:01:20,932 --> 00:01:21,921
-My joke!
-My joke!

28
00:01:22,172 --> 00:01:23,491
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

29
00:01:23,772 --> 00:01:25,490
Jokes? What. . .?

30
00:01:25,692 --> 00:01:28,160
You know there's naked chicks
in there, right?

31
00:01:30,372 --> 00:01:32,363
The One With The Joke

32
00:01:34,852 --> 00:01:35,841
English Subtitles by
Gelula/SDI

33
00:02:08,972 --> 00:02:11,611
Dude! You have got to turn on
Behind The Music.

34
00:02:11,852 --> 00:02:15,242
The band Heart is having a tough
time and they may break up.

35
00:02:15,492 --> 00:02:17,369
Let's watch that at your place.

36
00:02:17,612 --> 00:02:20,888
Monica's watching a show. I don't
want to miss when they were skinny.

37
00:02:21,532 --> 00:02:23,966
Hey, Chandler?
You know what we should do?

38
00:02:24,212 --> 00:02:27,682
You and I should go out
and get some new sunglasses.

39
00:02:28,052 --> 00:02:30,247
What? No, I want to watch this.

40
00:02:32,972 --> 00:02:36,487
-Did your cable go out?
-No. No, that's VH1 .

41
00:02:36,852 --> 00:02:39,491
I tell you, the music
these kids listen to today. . .

42
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:41,125
. . .it's a lot of noise to me.

43
00:02:43,692 --> 00:02:44,886
Why is your cable out?

44
00:02:45,492 --> 00:02:48,564
Oh, because I haven't really
paid the bill.

45
00:02:49,052 --> 00:02:52,124
If you need money,
would you please let me loan you some?

46
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,681
No, Chandler. Forget about it, okay?

47
00:02:54,932 --> 00:02:58,720
I know things have been tight since
Janine moved out. God, was she hot.

48
00:02:59,452 --> 00:03:00,680
I know, yeah.

49
00:03:00,932 --> 00:03:04,720
Look, I can handle it, all right?
I can listen to the radio.

50
00:03:04,932 --> 00:03:07,844
And Ross gave me this great book.

51
00:03:08,612 --> 00:03:12,082
Want to see if the joke stealer
will let us watch at his place?

52
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,486
Sure.

53
00:03:15,532 --> 00:03:16,965
-Paid your phone bill?
-No.

54
00:03:26,732 --> 00:03:28,290
It's only you.

55
00:03:29,052 --> 00:03:31,520
-What are you doing?
-Looking at a Playboy.

56
00:03:31,852 --> 00:03:32,887
I want to look too!

57
00:03:36,052 --> 00:03:37,280
Yikes!

58
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:42,083
Do you think these pictures
are trying to tell a story?

59
00:03:42,652 --> 00:03:45,212
Sure. Like in the case
of this young woman. . .

60
00:03:45,452 --> 00:03:47,602
. . .she has lost her clothes.

61
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:52,642
So she rides naked on the horse,
she's crying out, "Where are they?"

62
00:03:53,852 --> 00:03:57,083
She's not gonna find them,
lying in the grass like that.

63
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:04,000
Remember the days when you'd
go out to the barn. . .

64
00:04:04,252 --> 00:04:06,288
. . .Iift up your shirt and bend over?

65
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:13,284
You see, now, I would date this girl.

66
00:04:13,492 --> 00:04:16,006
She's cute, she's outdoorsy.

67
00:04:16,252 --> 00:04:19,289
And she knows how to build a fire.
That'll come in handy.

68
00:04:19,972 --> 00:04:20,961
I got a question.

69
00:04:21,292 --> 00:04:24,682
If you had to pick one of us to date,
who would it be?

70
00:04:25,572 --> 00:04:27,130
-I don't know.
-Me neither.

71
00:04:27,372 --> 00:04:28,691
Rachel.

72
00:04:29,772 --> 00:04:30,761
What?

73
00:04:32,252 --> 00:04:34,083
I don't know.

74
00:04:34,852 --> 00:04:36,080
Me neither.

75
00:04:39,772 --> 00:04:43,685
You know, you forget how many
great songs Heart had.

76
00:04:45,372 --> 00:04:49,081
"Barracuda" was the first song
I learned to play on the keyboard.

77
00:04:50,092 --> 00:04:52,686
So you heard it, you repeated it. . .

78
00:04:52,932 --> 00:04:55,492
. . .so that must mean you wrote it.

79
00:04:57,452 --> 00:05:00,125
You guys with this joke.
Well, I gotta say. . .

80
00:05:00,372 --> 00:05:03,045
. . .I know I cracked up,
but I'm not even sure I got it.

81
00:05:03,452 --> 00:05:04,646
What?

82
00:05:05,332 --> 00:05:06,526
You didn't get it?

83
00:05:06,772 --> 00:05:09,332
The doctor is a monkey.

84
00:05:10,452 --> 00:05:12,886
And monkeys
can't write out prescriptions.

85
00:05:15,372 --> 00:05:17,886
You are not allowed
to laugh at my joke.

86
00:05:18,772 --> 00:05:20,091
Your joke?

87
00:05:20,292 --> 00:05:23,090
Well, I think the Hef
would disagree.

88
00:05:23,332 --> 00:05:25,527
Which is why he sent me a check. . .

89
00:05:25,772 --> 00:05:27,888
. . .for $1 00.

90
00:05:28,092 --> 00:05:31,289
So you stole my joke
and you stole my money?

91
00:05:31,652 --> 00:05:33,483
I was gonna stick it in the ATM.

92
00:05:33,732 --> 00:05:36,485
But now I think I'll show
the sexy teller. . .

93
00:05:36,732 --> 00:05:39,405
. . .that I am a published writer.

94
00:05:39,652 --> 00:05:41,768
She'll know that you stole the joke.

95
00:05:42,012 --> 00:05:43,411
You gonna follow me there?

96
00:05:43,652 --> 00:05:45,370
-Yeah.
-I'm not gonna go now.

97
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:46,886
Okay.

98
00:05:49,572 --> 00:05:50,891
Here you go.

99
00:05:53,892 --> 00:05:55,041
Gunther?

100
00:05:55,532 --> 00:05:57,921
I can't pay now,
because I'm not working.

101
00:05:58,172 --> 00:06:00,686
I've had to cut down
on some luxuries like. . .

102
00:06:00,892 --> 00:06:03,281
. . .paying for stuff, so. . . .

103
00:06:04,892 --> 00:06:06,883
Well, if you want, you can work here.

104
00:06:07,692 --> 00:06:08,886
I don't know.

105
00:06:09,092 --> 00:06:10,286
It's just. . . .

106
00:06:10,772 --> 00:06:13,889
See, I was a regular on a soap opera,
you know?

107
00:06:14,092 --> 00:06:16,890
And to go from that to this,
it's just. . . .

108
00:06:17,132 --> 00:06:19,805
And plus, I'd have to wait
on all my friends.

109
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:21,730
Okay. But the money's good.

110
00:06:21,972 --> 00:06:24,691
Plus, you get to stare at Rachel
as much as you want.

111
00:06:27,252 --> 00:06:28,480
What?

112
00:06:28,692 --> 00:06:30,683
Flexible hours.

113
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,610
Maybe I could be a waiter.

114
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:35,171
Could I use the phone?

115
00:06:42,172 --> 00:06:43,400
She picked Rachel.

116
00:06:43,652 --> 00:06:47,884
She tried to back out of it, but
it was obvious. She picked Rachel.

117
00:06:48,372 --> 00:06:51,091
He took my joke. He just took it.

118
00:06:51,892 --> 00:06:54,406
This is wrong.
You know what else is wrong?

119
00:06:54,652 --> 00:06:56,290
Phoebe picking Rachel.

120
00:06:56,532 --> 00:06:58,329
Know who else picked Rachel? Ross.

121
00:06:58,572 --> 00:07:01,291
Know what else Ross did?
He stole my joke.

122
00:07:02,892 --> 00:07:05,122
I'm gonna get a joke journal,
you know?

123
00:07:05,372 --> 00:07:08,682
And document the date and time
of every single one of my jokes.

124
00:07:08,892 --> 00:07:11,087
Good idea. Know what's a bad idea?

125
00:07:11,332 --> 00:07:13,482
-Picking Rachel.
-That's right.

126
00:07:16,172 --> 00:07:17,525
Did you hear something?

127
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:21,731
Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing
into my brain to steal my thoughts.

128
00:07:22,372 --> 00:07:24,488
It's coming from the living room.

129
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:31,686
I finished my book.

130
00:07:39,132 --> 00:07:41,487
-Hey, you guys.
-Hey.

131
00:07:41,732 --> 00:07:43,688
Don't you guys look cute.

132
00:07:44,132 --> 00:07:45,770
You guys make a cute couple.

133
00:07:47,372 --> 00:07:48,771
What are you doing?

134
00:07:49,012 --> 00:07:52,891
Just trying to re-create some of
the fun that we had at my place.

135
00:07:53,132 --> 00:07:55,327
Remember? When you picked
Rachel over me?

136
00:07:55,572 --> 00:07:57,483
That was funny.

137
00:07:58,172 --> 00:08:00,686
-It was kind of funny.
-It wasn't funny at all!

138
00:08:02,132 --> 00:08:03,724
Why would you do that?

139
00:08:03,972 --> 00:08:05,803
Why didn't you pick me?

140
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,280
Fine.

141
00:08:07,652 --> 00:08:11,486
The reason I was leaning a little
bit more toward Rachel than you. . .

142
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:13,489
. . .is just, you know, you're. . .

143
00:08:14,132 --> 00:08:16,123
. . .high maintenance.
Let's go to lunch!

144
00:08:16,372 --> 00:08:18,681
That is completely untrue.

145
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:21,127
You think I'm high maintenance?
Prove it.

146
00:08:21,372 --> 00:08:24,808
You write out a list, and
we'll go through it point by point.

147
00:08:26,932 --> 00:08:28,923
No, you're right, you're easygoing.

148
00:08:30,732 --> 00:08:34,202
You're just not as easygoing
as Rachel. She's just more. . .

149
00:08:34,452 --> 00:08:36,647
. . .flexible and mellow. That's all.

150
00:08:39,932 --> 00:08:42,048
Well, people are different.

151
00:08:43,092 --> 00:08:46,971
Rachel will do whatever you want.
You can just walk all over her.

152
00:08:48,052 --> 00:08:51,806
What? Are you saying that I'm
a pushover? I'm not a pushover.

153
00:08:52,092 --> 00:08:55,084
Oh, okay. You're not a pushover.

154
00:08:56,572 --> 00:08:59,325
You think I'm a pushover.
Well, watch this.

155
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:01,324
You're not invited to lunch!

156
00:09:01,572 --> 00:09:03,927
What do you think?
Pretty strong, I think.

157
00:09:04,172 --> 00:09:06,288
Come on, Monica, let's go to lunch.

158
00:09:08,452 --> 00:09:10,488
You start working on that list.

159
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:15,722
-I cannot believe her.
-I know. Where do you want to eat?

160
00:09:16,692 --> 00:09:20,287
-Oh, I love that Japanese place.
-I'm sick of Japanese. Not there.

161
00:09:20,532 --> 00:09:22,887
Wherever you want to go is cool.

162
00:09:27,732 --> 00:09:28,926
Oh, hey, Gunther. . .

163
00:09:29,172 --> 00:09:30,685
. . .check this out.

164
00:09:33,292 --> 00:09:35,681
Yeah, that Chandler cracks me up.

165
00:09:39,692 --> 00:09:42,525
You want anything to drink?
I'm heading up there.

166
00:09:42,932 --> 00:09:45,048
-I'll take a coffee. Thanks.
-Sure.

167
00:09:45,612 --> 00:09:46,806
-Coffee?
-No.

168
00:09:47,052 --> 00:09:48,531
Coffee? I'm going up there.

169
00:09:48,732 --> 00:09:49,926
No, thank you.

170
00:09:51,372 --> 00:09:53,727
You need anything?
I'm heading up there.

171
00:09:54,172 --> 00:09:55,400
I'd love ice water.

172
00:09:55,652 --> 00:09:57,085
You got it.

173
00:09:58,412 --> 00:09:59,686
What are you doing?

174
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,206
Just being friendly.

175
00:10:03,372 --> 00:10:05,761
You're not supposed to go back there.

176
00:10:06,012 --> 00:10:07,331
It's okay. Right?

177
00:10:09,092 --> 00:10:10,684
Don't wink at me.

178
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:13,689
And put on your apron.

179
00:10:15,572 --> 00:10:16,766
Okay.

180
00:10:17,012 --> 00:10:20,482
I don't see you asking other
paying customers to put on aprons.

181
00:10:21,772 --> 00:10:24,366
-Joey, do you work here?
-No.

182
00:10:24,612 --> 00:10:26,045
-Waiter.
-Yeah!

183
00:10:32,372 --> 00:10:35,125
What's going on?
Why didn't you tell us you work here?

184
00:10:38,452 --> 00:10:42,525
It's kind of embarrassing. I mean,
I was an actor, now I'm a waiter.

185
00:10:42,772 --> 00:10:44,888
It's supposed to go
the other direction.

186
00:10:45,692 --> 00:10:48,286
So's your apron.
You're wearing it like a cape.

187
00:10:49,572 --> 00:10:52,530
I mean, the job's easy
and the money's good, you know?

188
00:10:52,772 --> 00:10:56,526
I guess if I'm hanging out here,
I might as well get paid for it.

189
00:10:56,772 --> 00:10:59,844
I just feel kind of weird
serving you guys, you know?

190
00:11:00,052 --> 00:11:01,121
It'll be great.

191
00:11:01,372 --> 00:11:03,681
Come on, I did it and it was fine.

192
00:11:03,892 --> 00:11:05,325
Why would it be weird?

193
00:11:05,572 --> 00:11:08,405
Hey, Joey? Can I get some coffee?

194
00:11:09,532 --> 00:11:11,488
It doesn't seem that weird.

195
00:11:11,732 --> 00:11:14,292
I asked before.
You still haven't gotten it.

196
00:11:15,972 --> 00:11:18,088
See, now it's weird again.

197
00:11:18,772 --> 00:11:22,048
You're gonna make a lot of money.
Here's your first tip.

198
00:11:23,372 --> 00:11:25,488
Don't eat yellow snow.

199
00:11:27,892 --> 00:11:30,406
2: 1 5, coffeehouse.

200
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:35,284
This is great. Finally,
someone I can pass my wisdom to.

201
00:11:35,532 --> 00:11:38,330
Let me tell you some things
I learned working here.

202
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,488
First, the customer is always right.

203
00:11:42,652 --> 00:11:45,041
A smile goes a long way.

204
00:11:46,732 --> 00:11:50,247
And if anyone is ever rude to you,
sneeze muffin.

205
00:11:52,132 --> 00:11:53,121
Thanks, Rach.

206
00:11:54,892 --> 00:11:57,690
Hey, look, you guys are just terrific,
you know?

207
00:11:57,932 --> 00:12:00,890
How about clearing out
so I can get some new customers?

208
00:12:01,092 --> 00:12:03,083
It's all about turnover.

209
00:12:06,172 --> 00:12:08,049
Seriously, can I get my coffee?

210
00:12:09,492 --> 00:12:11,483
I'm sorry. I'll get it right now.

211
00:12:11,972 --> 00:12:14,691
And since you waited,
I'll toss in a free muffin.

212
00:12:20,852 --> 00:12:22,763
Phoebe, we'd like to talk to you.

213
00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:24,486
Okay.

214
00:12:24,772 --> 00:12:27,730
So, maybe I am
a little high maintenance.

215
00:12:27,972 --> 00:12:30,725
And maybe Rachel is
a little bit of a pushover.

216
00:12:30,972 --> 00:12:32,564
But you know what you are?

217
00:12:32,812 --> 00:12:36,361
We are sorry to tell you this,
but you, Phoebe, are flaky.

218
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,410
That's true, I am flaky.

219
00:12:42,852 --> 00:12:46,288
So, what, you're just okay
with being flaky?

220
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:48,090
Yeah, totally.

221
00:12:48,932 --> 00:12:51,321
Then I'm okay
with being high maintenance.

222
00:12:51,572 --> 00:12:54,325
Yeah. And I am okay
with being a pushover.

223
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,802
That's great. Good for you guys.

224
00:12:57,452 --> 00:13:00,091
-I am not high maintenance!
-I am not a pushover!

225
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,688
-Who said you were?
-You did!

226
00:13:03,892 --> 00:13:06,167
I'm flaky. I'll say anything.

227
00:13:12,132 --> 00:13:13,326
Hey, Gunther.

228
00:13:13,572 --> 00:13:15,847
Can you cover for me?
I got an audition.

229
00:13:16,172 --> 00:13:18,481
No, I'm leaving to get my hair dyed.

230
00:13:20,292 --> 00:13:22,044
I like your natural color.

231
00:13:24,532 --> 00:13:27,808
It's a great part.
I'm the lead guy's best friend.

232
00:13:28,052 --> 00:13:30,282
I wait for him and save his seat.
Listen.

233
00:13:31,252 --> 00:13:33,482
"I'm sorry, that seat's saved. "

234
00:13:35,572 --> 00:13:39,451
-That's the whole part?
-Maybe he's not his best friend.

235
00:13:39,812 --> 00:13:40,881
I'll see you.

236
00:13:42,172 --> 00:13:43,685
Oh, man.

237
00:13:43,892 --> 00:13:47,521
I could totally get that part.
"I'm sorry, this seat is taken. "

238
00:13:47,772 --> 00:13:50,923
-Excuse me.
-No, I didn't mean you.

239
00:13:51,172 --> 00:13:52,366
But you believed me?

240
00:13:53,252 --> 00:13:56,289
I believed you were saving this seat
for someone.

241
00:13:57,052 --> 00:13:58,531
So you'd hire me, right?

242
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,290
For what?

243
00:14:01,852 --> 00:14:04,412
Exactly!
All right, everybody listen up!

244
00:14:04,652 --> 00:14:07,291
The coffeehouse will be closed
for about an hour.

245
00:14:07,532 --> 00:14:09,568
What?

246
00:14:10,012 --> 00:14:11,331
It's for the kids.

247
00:14:11,572 --> 00:14:14,211
Yeah, to keep the kids off drugs.

248
00:14:14,452 --> 00:14:17,888
It's a very important issue
in this month's Playboy.

249
00:14:18,092 --> 00:14:19,889
I'm sure you all read about it.

250
00:14:29,972 --> 00:14:32,088
-It's my joke.
-It's my joke.

251
00:14:35,172 --> 00:14:36,924
It's my joke.

252
00:14:38,372 --> 00:14:40,602
I don't think we're gonna settle this.

253
00:14:41,732 --> 00:14:43,370
Let's have Monica decide.

254
00:14:44,052 --> 00:14:45,565
-Hey, Mon!
-Get out here!

255
00:14:45,812 --> 00:14:47,689
-Monica?
-Okay.

256
00:14:47,892 --> 00:14:50,122
You have to decide whose joke this is.

257
00:14:50,332 --> 00:14:51,321
Why do I have to?

258
00:14:51,572 --> 00:14:53,608
You're the only one that can be fair.

259
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:55,649
I can't be. You're my boyfriend.

260
00:14:55,852 --> 00:14:57,888
But I'm your brother. We're family.

261
00:14:58,092 --> 00:15:01,767
That's the most important thing
in the world.

262
00:15:03,692 --> 00:15:05,364
Don't try to sway her.

263
00:15:05,732 --> 00:15:08,485
I'm your only chance to have a baby.

264
00:15:12,172 --> 00:15:13,605
-Okay, let's go.
-All right.

265
00:15:13,852 --> 00:15:17,288
We'll each tell you
how we came up with the joke. . .

266
00:15:17,532 --> 00:15:21,320
. . .then you decide which one of us
is telling the truth. Me.

267
00:15:22,012 --> 00:15:23,206
Chandler, you first.

268
00:15:23,452 --> 00:15:26,683
I thought of the joke two months ago
at lunch with Steve.

269
00:15:26,932 --> 00:15:29,321
-Did I meet him at Christmas?
-Can I finish?

270
00:15:29,572 --> 00:15:30,971
You want me to pick you?

271
00:15:32,172 --> 00:15:35,289
See, I would never
snap at you like that.

272
00:15:37,092 --> 00:15:39,526
Two babies.

273
00:15:43,292 --> 00:15:44,486
-Continue.
-Okay.

274
00:15:44,692 --> 00:15:49,208
Steve said he had to go to the doctor.
And his doctor's name is Dr. Mompey.

275
00:15:49,452 --> 00:15:54,287
I said, "Dr. Monkey?" And that is how
the whole Dr. Monkey thing came up.

276
00:15:58,452 --> 00:16:00,010
Are you kidding?

277
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:03,001
Okay, look, I study evolution.

278
00:16:03,252 --> 00:16:04,605
Remember? Evolution.

279
00:16:04,852 --> 00:16:06,331
Monkey into man.

280
00:16:06,572 --> 00:16:08,164
Plus, I'm a doctor. And. . .

281
00:16:08,412 --> 00:16:11,290
. . .I had a monkey.

282
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,203
I'm Dr. Monkey!

283
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:20,082
I'm not arguing with that.

284
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:22,368
I've heard enough for my decision.

285
00:16:22,612 --> 00:16:24,125
-Okay, so what--?
-Do tell.

286
00:16:24,372 --> 00:16:26,442
You are both idiots.

287
00:16:28,052 --> 00:16:30,520
It's not funny.
And it's offensive to women.

288
00:16:30,772 --> 00:16:32,808
And doctors. And monkeys.

289
00:16:34,172 --> 00:16:36,208
You shouldn't argue
over who gets credit.

290
00:16:36,452 --> 00:16:41,082
You should argue over who gets blamed
for inflicting this joke on the world.

291
00:16:41,332 --> 00:16:42,685
Now, let it go.

292
00:16:42,892 --> 00:16:44,689
The joke sucks.

293
00:16:50,332 --> 00:16:52,129
-It's your joke.
-It is not.

294
00:17:06,932 --> 00:17:10,288
-Oh, my God, Chandler, there you are.
-Hi.

295
00:17:10,972 --> 00:17:12,928
Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel.

296
00:17:13,172 --> 00:17:14,491
Why don't you tell them. . .

297
00:17:14,692 --> 00:17:18,082
. . .what you told me about me
not being high maintenance.

298
00:17:20,772 --> 00:17:24,481
Monica is a self-sufficient,
together lady.

299
00:17:26,252 --> 00:17:29,050
Being with her
has been like being on a vacation.

300
00:17:31,452 --> 00:17:34,125
And what may be perceived
as high maintenance. . .

301
00:17:34,372 --> 00:17:36,886
. . .is merely attention to detail. . .

302
00:17:37,092 --> 00:17:38,366
. . .and. . .

303
00:17:39,452 --> 00:17:41,682
. . .generosity of spirit.

304
00:17:43,452 --> 00:17:48,003
Wow. You know what? That is the best
fake speech I think I've ever heard.

305
00:17:48,252 --> 00:17:49,890
Really? I've heard better.

306
00:17:50,892 --> 00:17:53,850
Wait, he came up with that himself.
Tell them.

307
00:17:55,092 --> 00:17:57,003
I'm out of words.
Should I say it again?

308
00:17:57,252 --> 00:17:59,129
Look, I am not high maintenance!

309
00:17:59,372 --> 00:18:01,124
I am not. Chandler!

310
00:18:03,732 --> 00:18:05,688
You're a little high maintenance.

311
00:18:06,372 --> 00:18:08,010
You are on my list!

312
00:18:09,492 --> 00:18:11,403
Look, I'm sorry, but you're not--

313
00:18:11,652 --> 00:18:14,325
You're not easygoing,
but you're passionate.

314
00:18:14,572 --> 00:18:15,766
And that's good.

315
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:19,721
And when you get upset about little
things, I think I'm pretty good. . .

316
00:18:19,972 --> 00:18:21,724
. . .at making you feel better.

317
00:18:21,972 --> 00:18:24,770
That's good too.
They say you're high maintenance. . .

318
00:18:25,012 --> 00:18:27,480
. . .but it's okay, because I like. . .

319
00:18:29,172 --> 00:18:31,083
. . .maintaining you.

320
00:18:38,972 --> 00:18:40,371
I didn't tell him that.

321
00:18:44,492 --> 00:18:47,086
-You're off my list.
-I'm off the list.

322
00:18:47,452 --> 00:18:48,680
Phoebe?

323
00:18:49,852 --> 00:18:52,889
It's okay that you don't want me
to be your girlfriend.

324
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,770
I have the best boyfriend.

325
00:18:56,252 --> 00:18:59,483
You know,
suddenly I find you very attractive.

326
00:19:02,572 --> 00:19:04,005
How'd the audition go?

327
00:19:04,252 --> 00:19:05,571
Oh, not good. No.

328
00:19:05,772 --> 00:19:09,321
I didn't get the part.
And I lost my job here, so. . . .

329
00:19:09,572 --> 00:19:11,369
Wow, that is a bad audition.

330
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:15,886
Well, how did you lose your job here?

331
00:19:16,132 --> 00:19:17,326
I had the audition. . .

332
00:19:17,572 --> 00:19:21,042
. . .but Gunther said I had to stay
so he could get his hair dyed.

333
00:19:21,252 --> 00:19:23,322
So I went anyway, and he fired me.

334
00:19:23,572 --> 00:19:26,291
He left work
to do a personal errand. . .

335
00:19:26,492 --> 00:19:29,723
. . .and left you in charge
when you've been here two days?

336
00:19:29,972 --> 00:19:31,200
That's not right.

337
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:33,489
What are you gonna do?

338
00:19:33,692 --> 00:19:36,286
You can't let him get away with that.

339
00:19:36,492 --> 00:19:39,529
I won't let him get away with that.
I'm gonna say--

340
00:19:39,772 --> 00:19:42,923
I shouldn't say anything.
No, I should say something!

341
00:19:46,092 --> 00:19:49,084
Gunther?
I want you to give Joey his job back.

342
00:19:49,332 --> 00:19:52,881
-It's not fair that you have to fire--
-Okay.

343
00:19:56,372 --> 00:19:58,761
-What?
-He can have his job back.

344
00:20:00,172 --> 00:20:03,050
That's right,
he can have his job back.

345
00:20:04,572 --> 00:20:06,881
Glad we got that all straightened out.

346
00:20:08,132 --> 00:20:09,406
There you go, Joey.

347
00:20:09,652 --> 00:20:12,928
-Got your job back.
-That's great. Thanks.

348
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:15,891
Pretty nice, huh?
Now who's a pushover?

349
00:20:16,572 --> 00:20:18,688
-Rach, you're in my seat.
-I'm sorry.

350
00:20:24,532 --> 00:20:27,330
I never heard who you'd pick
to be your girlfriend.

351
00:20:27,652 --> 00:20:30,803
-I'd pick you, Phoebe.
-Yeah, definitely you, Pheebs.

352
00:20:31,052 --> 00:20:32,531
Yeah, I kind of thought.

353
00:20:36,132 --> 00:20:38,646
-Never.
-It would totally be you.

354
00:20:40,812 --> 00:20:44,009
If you had to pick one
of the other two to go out with. . .

355
00:20:44,252 --> 00:20:45,651
. . .who would you pick?

356
00:20:45,932 --> 00:20:47,206
-No way.
-I'm not answering.

357
00:20:47,452 --> 00:20:48,885
Joey.

358
00:20:51,732 --> 00:20:54,166
No way, I'm not answering that.
