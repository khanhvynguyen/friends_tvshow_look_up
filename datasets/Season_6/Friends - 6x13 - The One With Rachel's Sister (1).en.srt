1
00:00:02,492 --> 00:00:05,211
Okay, Rach, that's muffin
and espresso, $4.50.

2
00:00:05,412 --> 00:00:09,724
Ross, double latte, $2.75.
Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25.

3
00:00:09,972 --> 00:00:12,247
And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1 .25.

4
00:00:12,492 --> 00:00:15,052
All together that's $1 2.75.

5
00:00:15,412 --> 00:00:19,405
This coming from the man who couldn't
split our $80 phone bill in half.

6
00:00:21,292 --> 00:00:22,850
How much do I owe you?

7
00:00:23,052 --> 00:00:26,124
That's on the house,
courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.

8
00:00:26,892 --> 00:00:29,122
Great. Well, tell him thanks.

9
00:00:29,372 --> 00:00:32,250
And since Joey seems like
such a nice guy. . .

10
00:00:32,492 --> 00:00:33,925
. . .maybe we could go out?

11
00:00:34,132 --> 00:00:36,600
He's not used to women
being so forward. . .

12
00:00:36,852 --> 00:00:39,571
. . .but I could check with him.
He says it's okay.

13
00:00:41,852 --> 00:00:43,524
Great. Thanks. Bye-bye.

14
00:00:44,052 --> 00:00:45,929
How come our stuff isn't free?

15
00:00:46,132 --> 00:00:49,249
It will be when you look like
that in a tight skirt.

16
00:00:49,692 --> 00:00:51,683
I'm getting more dates than ever.

17
00:00:51,892 --> 00:00:54,725
You're only giving free stuff
to the pretty girls?

18
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:56,803
Joey, that is so gross!

19
00:00:57,492 --> 00:00:59,767
How about a scone on the house, baby?

20
00:01:01,692 --> 00:01:02,807
I'm pretty.

21
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:07,009
The One With Rachel's Sister

23
00:01:42,892 --> 00:01:45,611
-Hey, does anyone have any gum?
-I do.

24
00:01:48,252 --> 00:01:49,810
Here. Sorry.

25
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,404
Oh, you know what?

26
00:01:55,092 --> 00:01:56,207
No.

27
00:01:57,652 --> 00:01:59,005
Wait a second.

28
00:02:05,052 --> 00:02:07,885
-I know it's in here.
-You know what? I'm good.

29
00:02:09,532 --> 00:02:11,807
Why are you here?
Shouldn't you be at work?

30
00:02:12,012 --> 00:02:15,004
They sent me home.
They said I can't work if I'm sick.

31
00:02:16,372 --> 00:02:18,328
-Sorry you're sick.
-I'm not sick!

32
00:02:20,212 --> 00:02:24,410
I don't get sick. Getting sick is
for weaklings, it's for pansies.

33
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,648
No one thinks that you're a pansy. . .

34
00:02:27,892 --> 00:02:30,531
. . .but we do think
that you need a tissue.

35
00:02:33,492 --> 00:02:36,211
I have not been sick
in over three years.

36
00:02:38,052 --> 00:02:39,121
I'll get tissue.

37
00:02:39,372 --> 00:02:42,284
I don't need a tissue. I'm fine-d.

38
00:02:42,492 --> 00:02:45,006
When you put a "D" at
the end of fine. . .

39
00:02:45,252 --> 00:02:47,208
. . .you're not fine.

40
00:02:48,492 --> 00:02:49,971
I'm fine-d.

41
00:02:51,052 --> 00:02:53,008
I'm fine-d.

42
00:02:53,892 --> 00:02:56,201
It's a really hard word to say.

43
00:03:08,452 --> 00:03:11,489
-Yes?
-Hi. Is Rachel here? I'm her sister.

44
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:12,841
Oh, my God, Jill!

45
00:03:13,292 --> 00:03:14,884
Oh, my God, Rachel!

46
00:03:15,812 --> 00:03:17,848
Oh, my God, introduce us.

47
00:03:18,412 --> 00:03:21,404
This is Chandler.
And you know Monica and Ross.

48
00:03:21,972 --> 00:03:23,803
And that's Phoebe.
And that's Joey.

49
00:03:24,252 --> 00:03:25,731
-How you doing?
-Don't!

50
00:03:30,892 --> 00:03:32,928
Honey, what are you doing here?

51
00:03:33,132 --> 00:03:34,247
Which sister is this?

52
00:03:34,492 --> 00:03:37,290
Is this the spoiled one
or the one that bit her?

53
00:03:37,572 --> 00:03:38,721
Daddy cut me off.

54
00:03:38,932 --> 00:03:40,411
Never mind, I got it.

55
00:03:40,932 --> 00:03:42,251
You know what I said?

56
00:03:42,492 --> 00:03:45,802
I said, "I'll hire a lawyer,
sue you, take all your money. . .

57
00:03:46,012 --> 00:03:47,411
. . .and cut you off! "

58
00:03:47,692 --> 00:03:49,045
Wow. What did he say?

59
00:03:49,252 --> 00:03:50,970
That he wouldn't pay
for my lawyer.

60
00:03:52,372 --> 00:03:54,727
Then he told me to learn
the value of money. . .

61
00:03:54,972 --> 00:03:57,406
. . .from the one daughter
he's actually proud of.

62
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:01,845
Did you hear that?
My dad's proud of me.

63
00:04:02,092 --> 00:04:03,411
My dad's proud of me.

64
00:04:04,292 --> 00:04:05,850
-Rach?
-Oh, yeah. Sorry.

65
00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:09,289
Honey, so what did you do
that made dad cut you off?

66
00:04:10,212 --> 00:04:11,645
Okay, I bought a boat.

67
00:04:11,892 --> 00:04:13,245
You bought a boat?

68
00:04:13,892 --> 00:04:15,848
It wasn't for me,
it was for a friend.

69
00:04:17,212 --> 00:04:19,521
Boy, did we make friends
with the wrong sister.

70
00:04:21,772 --> 00:04:24,844
This is the best thing that
could've happened to you.

71
00:04:25,092 --> 00:04:27,128
You've needed to get out on your own.

72
00:04:27,372 --> 00:04:31,206
When I did it, at first I
was scared, but then look at me now.

73
00:04:31,452 --> 00:04:34,569
I am the only daughter
that Dad is proud of.

74
00:04:35,972 --> 00:04:38,611
This is what you'll do.
You're gonna get a job.

75
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:41,442
You're gonna get an apartment.

76
00:04:41,652 --> 00:04:44,086
And you can stay with us.
Right, Pheebs?

77
00:04:44,292 --> 00:04:45,202
Of course, yeah.

78
00:04:45,412 --> 00:04:46,811
Oh, that's so great!

79
00:04:47,052 --> 00:04:50,488
Okay, I'm really gonna do this.
I don't know how to thank you.

80
00:04:50,692 --> 00:04:52,762
Oh, I like cars.

81
00:04:58,772 --> 00:05:00,205
-You all finished?
-Yes.

82
00:05:00,412 --> 00:05:01,811
Great.

83
00:05:05,452 --> 00:05:07,807
Okay, here are the tips
for this morning.

84
00:05:08,052 --> 00:05:11,840
Jen gets 50, 50 for me
and Joey owes eight dollars.

85
00:05:13,372 --> 00:05:15,522
-What?
-For all the free food you gave away.

86
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,485
If it's free, how come
you're charging me for it?

87
00:05:19,772 --> 00:05:22,491
Don't give anything away
unless it's a birthday.

88
00:05:23,172 --> 00:05:26,084
What if they came in third
in a modeling contest?

89
00:05:27,252 --> 00:05:28,241
No.

90
00:05:28,492 --> 00:05:29,811
Sorry.

91
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:36,728
I just had the hardest day.
Some of these are so heavy.

92
00:05:37,852 --> 00:05:41,083
How did you pay? I thought
your dad took your credit card.

93
00:05:41,292 --> 00:05:43,760
I memorized those numbers
when I was 1 5.

94
00:05:45,132 --> 00:05:48,010
But look at all the cool
make-it-on-my-own stuff I got!

95
00:05:48,252 --> 00:05:51,050
This is my "Please, hire me" sweater.

96
00:05:51,292 --> 00:05:55,171
And these are my "Don't you want to
rent me this apartment?" pants.

97
00:05:56,212 --> 00:06:00,763
Charging clothes to your dad doesn't
qualify as making it on your own.

98
00:06:01,092 --> 00:06:04,004
Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get
all technical.

99
00:06:04,892 --> 00:06:07,326
Rachel's not gonna think
it's a good idea.

100
00:06:07,652 --> 00:06:11,406
-So who made her queen of the world?
-I would love that job!

101
00:06:13,812 --> 00:06:15,131
What's going on?

102
00:06:15,372 --> 00:06:16,805
Jill!

103
00:06:17,772 --> 00:06:19,125
Did you shop?

104
00:06:19,892 --> 00:06:21,245
No.

105
00:06:21,492 --> 00:06:22,607
They did.

106
00:06:24,172 --> 00:06:25,810
Yeah, we went shopping!

107
00:06:28,292 --> 00:06:29,611
You went shopping?

108
00:06:29,812 --> 00:06:32,849
Then you came here
and paraded it under Jill's nose. . .

109
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:35,731
. . .when you know she's trying to quit.
That's terrible.

110
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:38,125
Sorry, Jill.

111
00:06:40,292 --> 00:06:41,611
So what'd you get?

112
00:06:41,852 --> 00:06:44,047
Oh, well, all right. Thank you.

113
00:06:44,292 --> 00:06:47,841
I got this, you know,
"I want a job" sweater.

114
00:06:49,652 --> 00:06:53,804
And then I got. . . .
These are apartment pants.

115
00:06:55,812 --> 00:06:56,801
Apartment pants?

116
00:06:58,252 --> 00:06:59,605
You never heard of them?

117
00:07:00,612 --> 00:07:02,489
Of course, I've heard of them.

118
00:07:03,892 --> 00:07:05,405
Ross, what'd you get?

119
00:07:05,772 --> 00:07:07,967
I got this. . . .

120
00:07:09,052 --> 00:07:10,405
This.

121
00:07:12,452 --> 00:07:15,171
-A Pashmina?
-Yeah!

122
00:07:16,692 --> 00:07:19,411
I love these babies.

123
00:07:22,852 --> 00:07:24,331
Really?

124
00:07:24,572 --> 00:07:25,766
What's a Pashmina?

125
00:07:27,372 --> 00:07:28,566
It's a rug.

126
00:07:30,692 --> 00:07:31,681
Jill?

127
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:35,448
I'm sorry, Rachel.

128
00:07:35,972 --> 00:07:38,042
You think that's gonna work on me?

129
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:40,203
I invented that.

130
00:07:41,012 --> 00:07:43,480
Right! But I am sorry.

131
00:07:44,492 --> 00:07:47,052
It's okay.
One little setback is okay.

132
00:07:47,252 --> 00:07:49,163
But don't let it happen again, okay?

133
00:07:49,492 --> 00:07:50,447
Okay.

134
00:07:50,652 --> 00:07:54,804
Now, since Daddy paid for all this
stuff, I should take it all away.

135
00:07:55,012 --> 00:07:58,084
But I'm just gonna take the Pashmina.

136
00:08:00,252 --> 00:08:02,402
And the pants.

137
00:08:03,172 --> 00:08:06,767
I'll take it all, because that way,
you'll learn the lesson.

138
00:08:07,812 --> 00:08:08,801
Alrighty.

139
00:08:09,012 --> 00:08:12,607
I'm gonna run a couple of errands
and I will see you at dinner.

140
00:08:15,772 --> 00:08:17,649
She took all my stuff.

141
00:08:17,892 --> 00:08:22,329
Yeah. Everything but
the little blue one.

142
00:08:22,572 --> 00:08:23,800
That's the best one!

143
00:08:24,012 --> 00:08:26,446
Oh, my God. Thank you so much!

144
00:08:26,692 --> 00:08:28,444
Well, hey.

145
00:08:29,212 --> 00:08:32,522
Oh, my gosh, that was so lame.
Like a Pashmina could be a rug.

146
00:08:32,732 --> 00:08:36,281
Oh, yeah? How about you
with the "I'm sorry. "

147
00:08:36,492 --> 00:08:38,562
Shut up! I wasn't like that at all.

148
00:08:38,772 --> 00:08:42,765
What about what I said about
the apartment pants. How dumb was l?

149
00:08:46,252 --> 00:08:48,925
-Were you this cute in high school?
-Oh, stop.

150
00:08:49,132 --> 00:08:51,441
-No, you stop.
-No, you stop.

151
00:08:52,412 --> 00:08:54,880
Why don't I sit here
and then you'll both stop it.

152
00:08:58,172 --> 00:09:00,003
Okay, so what do you want to do?

153
00:09:00,692 --> 00:09:02,444
Let's do something crazy.

154
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:05,604
I know, let's rest and drink
lots of fluids.

155
00:09:06,692 --> 00:09:08,011
Okay, I'll rest.

156
00:09:08,212 --> 00:09:12,524
But if I'm going to bed,
then you're coming with me.

157
00:09:14,212 --> 00:09:17,807
See, that would be impossible to
resist if you weren't all. . .

158
00:09:18,052 --> 00:09:19,371
. . .drippy here.

159
00:09:21,252 --> 00:09:25,404
Are you saying that you don't
want to get with this?

160
00:09:29,772 --> 00:09:32,809
I don't think you should say that
even when you're healthy.

161
00:09:35,692 --> 00:09:37,205
Come on.

162
00:09:39,252 --> 00:09:41,004
Don't take this personally.

163
00:09:41,212 --> 00:09:43,851
I just can't have sex
with a sick person.

164
00:09:44,692 --> 00:09:49,004
I'm with you. I can't have sex with
a sick person either. Disgusting!

165
00:09:49,212 --> 00:09:50,247
But I'm not sick!

166
00:09:50,692 --> 00:09:52,603
Let me prove it to you.

167
00:09:53,532 --> 00:09:58,367
We are two healthy people
in the prime of life.

168
00:09:59,172 --> 00:10:03,484
See, that's the thing, I would like
to stay in the "prime of lime. "

169
00:10:07,812 --> 00:10:09,211
What's up?

170
00:10:09,892 --> 00:10:12,122
I think there's something
you should know.

171
00:10:12,332 --> 00:10:14,323
It better not be about
the apartment pants.

172
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:19,168
I just pitched the idea to my boss
at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.

173
00:10:19,892 --> 00:10:22,008
No. It's just, I was. . . .

174
00:10:22,252 --> 00:10:24,243
I was with Ross and Jill
after you left. . .

175
00:10:24,452 --> 00:10:27,649
. . .and I'm pretty sure I saw
a little spark between them.

176
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:30,567
-What?
-I mean, it's probably nothing.

177
00:10:30,772 --> 00:10:33,969
But I wanted to warn you
that there might be something.

178
00:10:34,452 --> 00:10:36,124
-With Ross and Jill?
-Yeah.

179
00:10:36,772 --> 00:10:38,524
With Ross and my sister?

180
00:10:41,412 --> 00:10:44,563
With my sister Jill
and my ex-boyfriend Ross?

181
00:10:46,172 --> 00:10:48,527
-Oh, there is no way.
-Okay, then.

182
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:51,610
Oh, my God! I cannot believe that!

183
00:10:52,172 --> 00:10:55,005
I don't like it when he dates anyone,
but my sister?

184
00:10:55,212 --> 00:10:57,168
Isn't that incest or something?

185
00:10:58,212 --> 00:11:00,123
And they're gonna have sex.

186
00:11:00,692 --> 00:11:03,411
Oh, no! What if he marries her too?

187
00:11:03,652 --> 00:11:06,086
This is just terrible.
This is just terrible.

188
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:08,522
And I can't stop it.
I don't own Ross.

189
00:11:08,772 --> 00:11:11,605
And Jill should be able to do
what she wants to do.

190
00:11:11,852 --> 00:11:15,606
Oh, my God, I can't believe Ross is
marrying my little sister.

191
00:11:15,852 --> 00:11:18,969
This is the worst thing that
could've ever happened to me.

192
00:11:20,612 --> 00:11:23,410
But great news about
the apartment pants, huh?

193
00:11:25,692 --> 00:11:27,205
That'll be $3.85.

194
00:11:27,452 --> 00:11:30,171
What? Yesterday you said
I was too pretty to pay.

195
00:11:30,692 --> 00:11:33,809
It's just, I can't,
because my manager said that l--

196
00:11:35,292 --> 00:11:38,409
Happy birthday to you

197
00:11:38,612 --> 00:11:40,807
Happy birthday to you

198
00:11:41,012 --> 00:11:43,810
-Happy birthday, dear Annie--
-Amy!

199
00:11:44,052 --> 00:11:46,043
--Amy

200
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:48,442
Happy birthday to you

201
00:11:49,172 --> 00:11:51,447
That's weird,
today's my birthday too.

202
00:11:51,652 --> 00:11:53,404
Not in here it isn't.

203
00:11:56,852 --> 00:11:58,524
Sorry I'm late. What's up?

204
00:12:00,852 --> 00:12:04,765
I just wanted to see if there were
any leads on the old job front.

205
00:12:04,972 --> 00:12:07,930
No. But I walked past three sales
and didn't go in.

206
00:12:08,172 --> 00:12:09,287
How strong am l?

207
00:12:10,852 --> 00:12:12,126
That is great.

208
00:12:12,372 --> 00:12:15,603
You know who doesn't have to
job-hunt? Ross.

209
00:12:15,852 --> 00:12:18,082
-He works at the university.
-Yeah?

210
00:12:18,412 --> 00:12:22,007
So you guys talked? So you get along?
So you're gonna go out?

211
00:12:23,892 --> 00:12:26,406
Me go out with Ross? No.

212
00:12:26,652 --> 00:12:29,007
God, no.
What would make you think that?

213
00:12:29,612 --> 00:12:30,647
Phoebe. . .

214
00:12:30,892 --> 00:12:34,009
. . .said she thought she saw something
between you guys.

215
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:35,930
I mean, he's nice.

216
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,448
He's the kind you're friends with,
but not the kind you date.

217
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:43,162
He's the kind you date,
because you did. But me?

218
00:12:43,892 --> 00:12:45,211
Not so much.

219
00:12:46,692 --> 00:12:51,368
Oh, not so much? What do you mean?
ls there something wrong with Ross?

220
00:12:51,692 --> 00:12:53,250
No, no, no. He's just. . . .

221
00:12:53,492 --> 00:12:56,290
I don't know.
You know, he's just a little bookish.

222
00:12:57,492 --> 00:12:59,050
Are you saying he's a geek?

223
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:00,805
You think so too?

224
00:13:01,772 --> 00:13:04,002
No. Ross is not a geek.

225
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:06,968
Then let's just say
he's not my type.

226
00:13:07,172 --> 00:13:09,606
Handsome is not your type?

227
00:13:09,852 --> 00:13:11,444
Smart, kind, good kisser.

228
00:13:11,692 --> 00:13:13,808
What, those things aren't
on your list?

229
00:13:14,012 --> 00:13:16,606
Ross is great.
You'd be lucky to be with him.

230
00:13:17,092 --> 00:13:19,526
If it means that much,
then I'll ask him out.

231
00:13:19,812 --> 00:13:22,201
Oh, no. That's not what I meant.

232
00:13:22,452 --> 00:13:24,124
You know what? You're right.

233
00:13:24,372 --> 00:13:26,567
He has been really nice to me.

234
00:13:27,172 --> 00:13:29,083
Yeah, but he's not your type.

235
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,211
But maybe that's good.

236
00:13:31,412 --> 00:13:33,403
I'm doing all these different things.

237
00:13:33,652 --> 00:13:36,405
Maybe I should just try
dating a geek too.

238
00:13:37,972 --> 00:13:41,123
Yeah, but you don't want
to try too much too fast.

239
00:13:42,252 --> 00:13:45,130
You remember what happened
to the little girl who. . .

240
00:13:45,372 --> 00:13:47,363
. . .tried too much too fast, don't you?

241
00:13:48,972 --> 00:13:50,007
What?

242
00:13:50,692 --> 00:13:52,887
She died, Jill.

243
00:13:58,052 --> 00:13:59,610
Chandler!

244
00:14:01,772 --> 00:14:05,048
What is it, honey?
You need some tea? Some soup?

245
00:14:11,012 --> 00:14:12,650
Calling Dr. Big.

246
00:14:12,892 --> 00:14:15,008
Dr. Big to the bed.

247
00:14:16,052 --> 00:14:19,169
Geez, honey,
I thought you were asleep.

248
00:14:19,412 --> 00:14:23,803
How could I be asleep knowing
that you were in the next room?

249
00:14:25,372 --> 00:14:26,566
I was asleep.

250
00:14:30,772 --> 00:14:34,003
No, honey. You know what's sexy?
Layers.

251
00:14:34,612 --> 00:14:35,931
Layers are sexy.

252
00:14:36,172 --> 00:14:39,642
And blankets are sexy.
And hot water bottles are sexy.

253
00:14:39,892 --> 00:14:42,360
Get into bed.
I want to prove I'm not sick.

254
00:14:42,892 --> 00:14:46,168
I want to make you feel
as good as I feel.

255
00:14:47,812 --> 00:14:49,768
Would you please get some rest?

256
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,610
I'm fine.

257
00:14:57,492 --> 00:15:00,006
Happy birthday to you

258
00:15:02,612 --> 00:15:05,410
-You're paying for that.
-No, it's her birthday.

259
00:15:05,652 --> 00:15:08,246
You've sung "Happy Birthday"
to 20 women today.

260
00:15:09,612 --> 00:15:13,446
You are no longer authorized to
distribute birthday muffins.

261
00:15:14,172 --> 00:15:15,605
Damn it!

262
00:15:20,692 --> 00:15:22,887
Did you tell your sister
to ask me out?

263
00:15:23,892 --> 00:15:27,521
-Well, yeah.
-Oh, wow! I mean, wow.

264
00:15:29,052 --> 00:15:31,646
I think she's cute, but. . .

265
00:15:31,892 --> 00:15:34,964
. . .I never would've thought of
going out with her. Never!

266
00:15:35,532 --> 00:15:36,567
Really?

267
00:15:36,772 --> 00:15:39,002
But after your okay,
I figured, "Why not?"

268
00:15:40,452 --> 00:15:42,886
Oh, so not really "never. "

269
00:15:43,772 --> 00:15:46,730
I have to say you are
a much bigger person than I am.

270
00:15:46,972 --> 00:15:49,440
I mean, after all we've been through.

271
00:15:49,892 --> 00:15:52,042
I wish I had a brother
to reciprocate.

272
00:15:54,492 --> 00:15:56,881
If you ever date Monica,
you have my blessing.

273
00:15:57,092 --> 00:15:58,525
And mine.

274
00:16:01,372 --> 00:16:02,361
Chandler?

275
00:16:03,012 --> 00:16:04,843
I think I'm sick.

276
00:16:05,612 --> 00:16:07,045
Really?

277
00:16:07,292 --> 00:16:09,203
Struck down in the "pribe of libe. "

278
00:16:11,452 --> 00:16:15,240
Okay, fine, I admit it.
I feel terrible.

279
00:16:15,492 --> 00:16:17,801
Will you please rub this on my chest?

280
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:22,364
No, no, no.
You are not getting me this way.

281
00:16:23,092 --> 00:16:25,811
Come on, I really need your help here.

282
00:16:28,092 --> 00:16:31,004
-Fine, I'll rub it on myself.
-Okay.

283
00:16:49,572 --> 00:16:53,042
So you're just kind of
rubbing it on yourself?

284
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:57,645
-Yeah.
-It's nice.

285
00:16:59,292 --> 00:17:01,567
You kidding me?
ls this turning you on?

286
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:03,205
Yes.

287
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:07,001
Is it the rubbing or the smell?

288
00:17:07,252 --> 00:17:09,686
It's all very, very good.

289
00:17:13,852 --> 00:17:15,683
So, you want to go. . .

290
00:17:17,292 --> 00:17:18,805
. . .mix it up?

291
00:17:20,492 --> 00:17:23,290
-Not now, I'm sick.
-Oh, come on, you big faker!

292
00:17:25,372 --> 00:17:27,602
What about never sleeping
with sick people?

293
00:17:27,892 --> 00:17:31,805
Well, that was before
all the vaporizing action.

294
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:35,923
Okay, if you really
want to have sex.

295
00:17:38,292 --> 00:17:40,203
Worked like a charm.

296
00:17:46,412 --> 00:17:47,401
Why are you here?

297
00:17:47,892 --> 00:17:52,010
This is where Ross and I are meeting
for our date. So, what do you think?

298
00:17:53,652 --> 00:17:54,641
I don't like it.

299
00:17:56,412 --> 00:17:59,006
-Really?
-It's kind of slutty.

300
00:18:00,452 --> 00:18:01,931
It's yours.

301
00:18:03,612 --> 00:18:05,807
Yeah, well, I'm a slut.

302
00:18:07,412 --> 00:18:08,561
Me too.

303
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:13,566
Hi, Jill.

304
00:18:13,772 --> 00:18:15,000
Hi. . . .

305
00:18:16,092 --> 00:18:17,411
Rachel.

306
00:18:19,092 --> 00:18:22,402
You're not at home,
you're right here.

307
00:18:23,012 --> 00:18:24,047
Yeah, I know.

308
00:18:24,292 --> 00:18:28,285
And I bet you thought it would
be weird. But it's not.

309
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:34,811
Okay.

310
00:18:35,652 --> 00:18:37,643
So, well, I'll. . . .

311
00:18:37,892 --> 00:18:39,803
I'll have her home by midnight.

312
00:18:58,852 --> 00:19:01,207
Why aren't you home yet?

313
00:19:01,452 --> 00:19:03,408
Is someone there?

314
