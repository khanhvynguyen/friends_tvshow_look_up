1
00:00:04,692 --> 00:00:06,125
Oh! Hey, Rach.

2
00:00:06,372 --> 00:00:09,808
I was just coming over here to. . . .

3
00:00:10,252 --> 00:00:13,210
Wait, I don't have to lie to you,
you don't live here anymore.

4
00:00:13,412 --> 00:00:15,050
I'm eating their food.
You?

5
00:00:16,372 --> 00:00:20,843
Ross is on a date with my sister.
They shut the drapes two hours ago.

6
00:00:21,092 --> 00:00:23,606
I didn't know we could
date your sister.

7
00:00:27,412 --> 00:00:29,164
We know you steal our food.

8
00:00:30,412 --> 00:00:31,606
I'm good.

9
00:00:32,492 --> 00:00:33,811
Drapes still closed?

10
00:00:34,052 --> 00:00:37,488
Yeah. That perverted couple
two doors over should've shut theirs.

11
00:00:37,732 --> 00:00:40,121
-Is that a swing?
-Oh, don't even ask.

12
00:00:43,892 --> 00:00:46,167
I can't believe Ross
is with her sister.

13
00:00:46,412 --> 00:00:49,165
When Chandler kissed my sister,
I was mad for 1 0 years.

14
00:00:49,812 --> 00:00:53,009
-That was five years ago.
-You got five years left.

15
00:00:53,692 --> 00:00:55,091
-Joey--
-Want to make it six?

16
00:00:57,092 --> 00:00:58,889

18
00:01:34,932 --> 00:01:38,004
Oh, Ross, hey. Hi, how are you?
There you are.

19
00:01:39,372 --> 00:01:40,805
Can I get a cup of coffee?

20
00:01:42,292 --> 00:01:44,806
So how was your big date last night?

21
00:01:46,292 --> 00:01:48,328
It was okay. It was fun.

22
00:01:48,572 --> 00:01:49,402
It was fun?

23
00:01:49,652 --> 00:01:50,801
Great.

24
00:01:52,772 --> 00:01:55,889
So did you guys hit it off?

25
00:01:57,812 --> 00:01:59,404
I guess so.

26
00:02:00,052 --> 00:02:03,727
So did anything happen?
Rumor has it you guys shut the drapes.

27
00:02:04,972 --> 00:02:06,610
No. No. Nothing happened.

28
00:02:06,852 --> 00:02:10,162
I shut the drapes to show her
slides of my favorite fossils.

29
00:02:12,252 --> 00:02:14,482
Oh, slides!

30
00:02:15,892 --> 00:02:18,201
So really nothing happened.

31
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,610
Something could've happened.

32
00:02:20,812 --> 00:02:22,803
She really dug my slides.

33
00:02:23,012 --> 00:02:26,641
And she was definitely
giving me the vibe.

34
00:02:27,092 --> 00:02:31,244
Was it the "Please don't show me
another picture of a trilobite" vibe?

35
00:02:31,892 --> 00:02:33,405
Anyway. . . .

36
00:02:33,812 --> 00:02:36,645
If she wasn't into me,
why would she ask me out again?

37
00:02:36,852 --> 00:02:39,082
-She asked you out again?
-Yeah.

38
00:02:40,212 --> 00:02:41,088
Tomorrow night.

39
00:02:41,572 --> 00:02:45,360
Valentine's Day. The most romantic
day of the year.

40
00:02:45,612 --> 00:02:47,204
Who knows what could happen.

41
00:02:47,452 --> 00:02:50,922
I might not be shutting my drapes
to show her my slides.

42
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:52,651
Okay! I got it, I got it.

43
00:02:52,892 --> 00:02:55,565
I can't go with the "you
and my sister" thing.

44
00:02:55,772 --> 00:02:57,763
It's just too weird, all right?

45
00:02:58,012 --> 00:03:00,128
I imagine the two of you together.

46
00:03:00,372 --> 00:03:02,761
It just freaks me out.
I can't do it!

47
00:03:05,612 --> 00:03:07,011
It's okay.

48
00:03:08,212 --> 00:03:11,204
It's too weird for you.
I won't see her again.

49
00:03:11,452 --> 00:03:12,248
Thank you.

50
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:13,845
After tomorrow night.

51
00:03:14,092 --> 00:03:16,925
No! I can't do it.
It's gonna freak me out!

52
00:03:17,172 --> 00:03:18,605
Okay, okay, okay!

53
00:03:19,692 --> 00:03:24,049
Okay. I'll tell her tonight
I can't see her anymore.

54
00:03:24,292 --> 00:03:25,805
Ross, thanks.

55
00:03:27,292 --> 00:03:28,645
Want me to call her now?

56
00:03:28,892 --> 00:03:31,611
Oh, no. No, no, no.

57
00:03:32,172 --> 00:03:34,732
No. Come on, I mean, that's crazy.

58
00:03:36,892 --> 00:03:39,360
So, what's going on with you?

59
00:03:39,972 --> 00:03:41,007
Well. . . .

60
00:03:41,252 --> 00:03:43,812
I may teach another class
this semester.

61
00:03:44,052 --> 00:03:45,644
Do it now. Call her now.

62
00:03:50,492 --> 00:03:52,722
-This is my favorite part.
-Me too.

63
00:03:55,252 --> 00:03:58,210
You know what's sadder
than this? Bambi.

64
00:03:58,812 --> 00:04:01,849
I cried for three days
with that movie. No, two.

65
00:04:02,092 --> 00:04:06,131
The third day my mom killed herself,
so I was partly crying for that.

66
00:04:07,892 --> 00:04:11,885
Well, that I can see crying
over, but Bambi is a cartoon.

67
00:04:12,092 --> 00:04:13,764
You didn't cry
when Bambi's mother died?

68
00:04:13,972 --> 00:04:17,408
Yes, it was very sad when the guy
stopped drawing the deer.

69
00:04:20,012 --> 00:04:23,641
It's okay to cry. You don't
have to be macho all the time.

70
00:04:23,852 --> 00:04:25,410
I'm not macho.

71
00:04:25,772 --> 00:04:27,410
Yeah, you're right.

72
00:04:28,292 --> 00:04:30,010
I don't know what I was thinking.

73
00:04:30,452 --> 00:04:34,081
I just never really cried.
I'm not a crying kind of guy.

74
00:04:34,332 --> 00:04:39,122
Come on, there's gotta be something
that gets you choked up. Like. . . .

75
00:04:39,372 --> 00:04:41,567
What if you saw a three-legged puppy?

76
00:04:43,092 --> 00:04:45,208
I'd be sad, sure.

77
00:04:45,412 --> 00:04:46,925
But I wouldn't cry.

78
00:04:47,172 --> 00:04:50,801
What if the puppy said,
"Help me, Chandler.

79
00:04:52,412 --> 00:04:55,210
All the other puppies pick on me. "

80
00:04:56,092 --> 00:04:59,289
Cry? I just found a talking puppy.
I'm rich!

81
00:05:01,692 --> 00:05:03,648
I've got it. I have got it.

82
00:05:03,892 --> 00:05:05,644
Pictures from your childhood.

83
00:05:05,892 --> 00:05:08,008
This'll get you going good.

84
00:05:09,172 --> 00:05:10,844
Oh, what's going on there?

85
00:05:11,092 --> 00:05:12,889
Parents' Day. First grade.

86
00:05:13,132 --> 00:05:16,602
That's me with the janitor, Martin.

87
00:05:17,052 --> 00:05:19,612
-Where are your parents?
-They didn't want to come.

88
00:05:19,972 --> 00:05:21,803
-Chandler!
-Poor thing.

89
00:05:22,052 --> 00:05:24,008
That story doesn't make you cry?

90
00:05:24,212 --> 00:05:27,204
No. Look, I don't cry.
It's not a big deal, okay?

91
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,647
No! It's not okay!

92
00:05:29,892 --> 00:05:31,610
It's not okay at all!

93
00:05:32,892 --> 00:05:34,086
You're dead inside!

94
00:05:38,652 --> 00:05:40,051
-Excuse me?
-Yeah?

95
00:05:40,292 --> 00:05:42,442
-Are you Phoebe Buffay?
-Yeah.

96
00:05:43,372 --> 00:05:45,886
Can I get your autograph?
I'm your biggest fan.

97
00:05:46,132 --> 00:05:48,726
My biggest fan?
I've always wanted to meet you.

98
00:05:50,092 --> 00:05:51,047
Sure. Yeah.

99
00:05:51,292 --> 00:05:53,123
Wow. Wow, thanks a lot.

100
00:05:53,372 --> 00:05:56,284
I just want to say
I think you're really talented.

101
00:05:56,492 --> 00:05:59,131
You're just saying that
because you're my biggest fan.

102
00:06:00,692 --> 00:06:03,365
Take good care of that guy.
He's a fan.

103
00:06:05,692 --> 00:06:07,011
Bye.

104
00:06:08,932 --> 00:06:12,208
So you saw me
on Days of Our Lives, huh?

105
00:06:12,812 --> 00:06:16,202
You want me to do a little
Doctor Drake Ramoray for you?

106
00:06:19,892 --> 00:06:22,247
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

107
00:06:22,492 --> 00:06:24,847
But I just got Phoebe Buffay's
autograph.

108
00:06:25,092 --> 00:06:26,810
Oh. You're Phoebe's fan.

109
00:06:27,052 --> 00:06:30,010
Oh, yeah. I've seen all her movies.

110
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:32,322
Movies?

111
00:06:32,612 --> 00:06:35,684
That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.

112
00:06:40,892 --> 00:06:42,086
I don't think so.

113
00:06:42,332 --> 00:06:46,211
No, it was. She was in
Sex Toy Story Two...

114
00:06:46,772 --> 00:06:48,649
...Lawrence of a Labia.

115
00:06:50,052 --> 00:06:52,008
And I got her autograph.

116
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:55,011
The guys at the comic book store
won't believe this.

117
00:06:58,452 --> 00:06:59,441
Gunther?

118
00:06:59,692 --> 00:07:03,446
Don't let that guy in here anymore.
He said Phoebe's a porn star.

119
00:07:03,652 --> 00:07:07,804
Well, I wouldn't call her a star,
but she's really good.

120
00:07:08,412 --> 00:07:10,926
You should check out
lnspect Her Gadget.

121
00:07:15,972 --> 00:07:17,246
-Hey.
-Hey.

122
00:07:17,492 --> 00:07:21,565
Ross just totally blew me off,
and he didn't even tell me why.

123
00:07:21,972 --> 00:07:23,530
Oh, well.

124
00:07:23,972 --> 00:07:28,011
The best thing to do to get over a guy
is to start dating someone else.

125
00:07:28,252 --> 00:07:32,404
Oh! There is this great guy you
will just love at work, named Bob.

126
00:07:32,612 --> 00:07:35,445
He's a real up-and-comer
in Human Resources.

127
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:39,967
Thanks, but I'm not gonna date
some random guy from your work.

128
00:07:40,212 --> 00:07:42,442
Not random. Bob.

129
00:07:43,252 --> 00:07:47,245
It's probably because I'm not
mature enough or smart enough. . . .

130
00:07:47,492 --> 00:07:49,608
Maybe he doesn't
like the way I dress.

131
00:07:49,812 --> 00:07:53,122
No, that can't be it.
It's gotta be the smart thing.

132
00:07:53,892 --> 00:07:58,408
I'm so stupid. I'm just this, like,
incredibly pretty, stupid girl.

133
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:00,606
No, honey.

134
00:08:01,892 --> 00:08:02,847
Okay.

135
00:08:03,092 --> 00:08:06,402
Okay. You want to know why Ross
canceled the date?

136
00:08:06,692 --> 00:08:08,410
Because I asked him to.

137
00:08:09,052 --> 00:08:10,804
You asked him to?

138
00:08:11,012 --> 00:08:13,606
-Why?
-Because you are my sister. . .

139
00:08:13,812 --> 00:08:16,246
. . .and Ross and I have
this huge history.

140
00:08:16,492 --> 00:08:18,164
You want to go out with Ross?

141
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,168
No.

142
00:08:19,372 --> 00:08:21,363
You don't want him,
but you don't want me to?

143
00:08:22,452 --> 00:08:25,046
You know, Bob in Human Resources. . . .

144
00:08:25,452 --> 00:08:29,411
I can't believe you did this!
You had me doubting how smart I was!

145
00:08:29,612 --> 00:08:31,967
You had me doubting my fashion sense!

146
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:35,921
It's not that big a deal. Just
don't date Ross. There's other--

147
00:08:36,172 --> 00:08:38,606
You have no right
to tell me what to do.

148
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:42,401
I'm not telling you what to do.
I am telling you what not to do!

149
00:08:43,492 --> 00:08:45,210
Why are you so jealous of me?

150
00:08:45,452 --> 00:08:47,408
This is not about me being jealous.

151
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,530
It's about you being a brat,
wanting what you can't have.

152
00:08:50,772 --> 00:08:52,046
Can't have?

153
00:08:52,292 --> 00:08:55,250
Excuse me. The only thing
I can't have is dairy!

154
00:08:57,692 --> 00:09:00,411
Well, you just blew your chances
at dating Bob!

155
00:09:00,652 --> 00:09:02,483
-Who?
-With Human Resources!

156
00:09:05,092 --> 00:09:08,448
Jealous of her? Who does she think
she is, Princess Caroline?

157
00:09:09,772 --> 00:09:13,606
-You're jealous of Princess Caroline?
-Do I have my own castle?

158
00:09:15,372 --> 00:09:16,407
Hey.

159
00:09:16,652 --> 00:09:18,244
-Phoebe's not here, is she?
-No.

160
00:09:18,492 --> 00:09:19,561
Did you get a movie?

161
00:09:27,092 --> 00:09:28,207
Yeah. Yeah.

162
00:09:28,452 --> 00:09:31,728
But I don't think it's the kind
you're gonna like.

163
00:09:33,212 --> 00:09:37,091
Not more movies that'll have us
reaching for the tissues all night?

164
00:09:42,452 --> 00:09:44,010
Sort of.

165
00:09:45,492 --> 00:09:46,641
What's going on?

166
00:09:48,612 --> 00:09:51,001
Phoebe's a porn star!

167
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:52,441
-What?
-Yeah!

168
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,603
What are you talking about?

169
00:09:55,332 --> 00:09:59,689
"Phoebe Buffay in
Buffay The Vampire Layer. "

170
00:10:01,612 --> 00:10:03,887
That's Phoebe.
Where did you get that?

171
00:10:04,132 --> 00:10:06,407
At the adult video place on Bleecker.

172
00:10:06,652 --> 00:10:11,123
And I saw Joey was about to go in,
so I ran in ahead of him. . .

173
00:10:11,372 --> 00:10:14,603
. . .to surprise him.

174
00:10:14,852 --> 00:10:18,811
Then I pretended that I didn't
know he was in there.

175
00:10:22,012 --> 00:10:24,845
Wow. I mean,
I just can't believe this.

176
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:27,242
I mean, you think you know someone.

177
00:10:27,492 --> 00:10:30,643
Even Phoebe, who's always been
somewhat of a question mark.

178
00:10:31,852 --> 00:10:33,843
This is so bizarre.

179
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:37,402
I guess it makes sense.
She had such a terrible childhood.

180
00:10:37,652 --> 00:10:39,802
I had a bad childhood
and I don't do porn.

181
00:10:41,252 --> 00:10:42,924
Yes, but you're dead inside.

182
00:10:43,772 --> 00:10:45,569
I'd better take that back.

183
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:46,847
What, why? Why?

184
00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:49,044
We can't watch it.
It's Phoebe.

185
00:10:50,172 --> 00:10:51,605
We shouldn't watch this.

186
00:10:51,812 --> 00:10:54,007
Absolutely not. That goes back.

187
00:10:54,852 --> 00:10:56,649
-Maybe a bit.
-The first half?

188
00:10:58,172 --> 00:11:00,845
This is wrong, you guys!
Phoebe's our friend!

189
00:11:01,092 --> 00:11:03,208
-I'm not gonna watch it.
-Yeah!

190
00:11:03,612 --> 00:11:05,045
Good for you, Joe.

191
00:11:18,692 --> 00:11:21,570
I thought I'd find you here,
Nosferatool.

192
00:11:23,172 --> 00:11:26,801
Are you going to plunge
your stake into my dark places?

193
00:11:27,012 --> 00:11:31,608
Actually, I was kind of hoping it
would be the other way around.

194
00:11:34,172 --> 00:11:35,651
What's that on her ankle?

195
00:11:35,892 --> 00:11:38,008
Her ankle is what you're watching?

196
00:11:39,012 --> 00:11:41,401
Well, it's hard to tell.

197
00:11:42,332 --> 00:11:44,482
God, if she would just stop moving.

198
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:47,088
She's just doing her job.

199
00:11:47,492 --> 00:11:49,403
You sick bastards!

200
00:11:50,692 --> 00:11:52,125
It's a tattoo.

201
00:11:52,372 --> 00:11:54,408
That's weird. Phoebe doesn't--

202
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:58,568
Wait, that's Ursula!
That's not Phoebe! That is Ursula!

203
00:11:59,212 --> 00:12:02,249
Wait, wait! I can watch that!
Rewind it! Rewind it!

204
00:12:03,972 --> 00:12:05,200
Hey.

205
00:12:05,412 --> 00:12:08,006
What's up? Oh, my God!
What am I doing?!

206
00:12:17,132 --> 00:12:18,087
Hey, sweetie.

207
00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:25,408
"Chicken Soup for the Soul"?

208
00:12:26,492 --> 00:12:28,528
There's no back to this couch.

209
00:12:30,452 --> 00:12:32,249
You hate this kind of stuff.

210
00:12:32,492 --> 00:12:34,289
I figured I'd give it a shot.

211
00:12:34,532 --> 00:12:38,969
One of the stories may make me cry,
then you won't think I'm dead inside.

212
00:12:39,612 --> 00:12:41,728
Oh, that's so sweet.

213
00:12:41,972 --> 00:12:44,122
I don't care if you can't cry.
I love you.

214
00:12:44,372 --> 00:12:48,206
Oh, that makes me feel so warm
in my hollow tin chest.

215
00:12:48,972 --> 00:12:50,610
Stop it.

216
00:12:50,852 --> 00:12:55,004
Seriously. We get married, I'm up
at the altar and I'm like this:

217
00:12:57,052 --> 00:12:58,201
I won't care.

218
00:12:58,452 --> 00:13:01,410
I know that you'll be feeling it
all in here.

219
00:13:02,172 --> 00:13:03,446
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

220
00:13:03,692 --> 00:13:05,648
And if we have a baby one day. . .

221
00:13:05,892 --> 00:13:08,725
. . .and the doctor hands it to you
in the delivery room. . .

222
00:13:08,972 --> 00:13:11,327
. . .and you don't cry, so what?

223
00:13:12,452 --> 00:13:15,046
If we take him to college
and go home. . .

224
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:18,409
. . .and we see his empty room
for the first time. . .

225
00:13:18,692 --> 00:13:20,603
. . .and you got nothing?

226
00:13:21,852 --> 00:13:23,604
It won't matter to me.

227
00:13:25,612 --> 00:13:27,011
Okay.

228
00:13:27,572 --> 00:13:30,132
I won't worry
about this anymore then.

229
00:13:30,372 --> 00:13:32,408
And then, you know, if I die. . .

230
00:13:34,172 --> 00:13:36,481
. . .from a long illness. . .

231
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,609
. . .and you're writing my eulogy. . .

232
00:13:38,812 --> 00:13:42,202
. . .and you open the desk drawer
and find a note from me that says:

233
00:13:42,412 --> 00:13:45,210
"I will always be with you" . . .

234
00:13:45,652 --> 00:13:49,804
. . .and you still can't shed
one tiny tear?

235
00:13:50,812 --> 00:13:52,882
I know you'll be
crying a river inside.

236
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,442
-I love you.
-What is wrong with you?!

237
00:13:58,492 --> 00:13:59,402
-What?
-What?

238
00:13:59,892 --> 00:14:02,611
You can't shed a tear
for your dead wife?

239
00:14:02,812 --> 00:14:04,564
I left you a note from the beyond!

240
00:14:04,812 --> 00:14:07,645
-So you didn't mean any of that?
-No, you robot!

241
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:17,564
You damn kids! You ring my bell
one more time and I swear--

242
00:14:17,812 --> 00:14:19,803
Oh, Jill!

243
00:14:20,972 --> 00:14:23,645
That's a game I play
with the kids down the hall.

244
00:14:25,252 --> 00:14:27,402
They've really taken a liking to me.

245
00:14:29,492 --> 00:14:30,686
What's the matter?

246
00:14:31,092 --> 00:14:33,970
Rachel and I had a big fight.
Can I come in?

247
00:14:34,212 --> 00:14:37,284
I know we're not supposed
to see each other anymore.

248
00:14:37,492 --> 00:14:40,928
I don't know anybody in this city
and I need somebody to talk to.

249
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,491
Sure. What happened?

250
00:14:42,732 --> 00:14:44,609
I don't want to talk about it.

251
00:14:47,492 --> 00:14:49,005
Okay.

252
00:14:50,772 --> 00:14:53,240
-You know what might cheer me up?
-What?

253
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:56,211
Seeing some more of your
super cool slides.

254
00:14:57,412 --> 00:14:59,846
-Wow, really?
-Totally. I loved them.

255
00:15:00,092 --> 00:15:03,528
You could finish telling me about
the different kinds of sand.

256
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:09,965
I'd love to. Wait right here, I'll go
get the projector and my notes.

257
00:15:10,212 --> 00:15:12,407
Thanks. You're such a good friend.

258
00:15:18,692 --> 00:15:21,286
Have you guys seen Jill?
I can't find her.

259
00:15:21,532 --> 00:15:22,851
-No.
-Is Ross home?

260
00:15:23,092 --> 00:15:25,890
Maybe I'll call him and see
if he's seen her--

261
00:15:34,492 --> 00:15:35,447
Who is it?

262
00:15:35,692 --> 00:15:37,330
It's Phoebe. . .

263
00:15:37,772 --> 00:15:38,682
. . . "Phoebe! "

264
00:15:40,492 --> 00:15:41,288
Hey!

265
00:15:41,532 --> 00:15:42,851
Oh, God!

266
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:47,010
So you're making porn movies.

267
00:15:47,412 --> 00:15:48,811
No, I'm not.

268
00:15:49,012 --> 00:15:50,968
We're still rolling!

269
00:15:51,212 --> 00:15:52,884
You're making one right now!

270
00:15:53,772 --> 00:15:54,887
Let's go, Phoebe.

271
00:15:55,132 --> 00:15:56,804
And you're using my name.

272
00:15:57,252 --> 00:15:58,844
Can I help you with something?

273
00:16:00,252 --> 00:16:01,128
Phoebe, come on!

274
00:16:01,372 --> 00:16:05,206
Look, I'm talking right now.
You mean her. Oh.

275
00:16:05,652 --> 00:16:08,610
You know, twin stuff is always
a real big seller.

276
00:16:08,852 --> 00:16:10,001
What?

277
00:16:11,212 --> 00:16:13,442
I could talk them into giving you. . .

278
00:16:13,692 --> 00:16:14,841
. . .thirty dollars.

279
00:16:17,012 --> 00:16:19,003
No! No way! No!

280
00:16:19,252 --> 00:16:22,164
And stop using my name!
And shame on you!

281
00:16:22,412 --> 00:16:25,051
And shame on all of you!
You're disgusting!

282
00:16:25,292 --> 00:16:27,169
Especially you, with that!

283
00:16:30,292 --> 00:16:33,011
The slides are almost ready.

284
00:16:33,772 --> 00:16:34,648
Yeah.

285
00:16:34,892 --> 00:16:37,008
I know what this is missing:

286
00:16:37,252 --> 00:16:38,731
Alcohol.

287
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,004
There's wine in the kitchen.

288
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:43,401
Oh, great.

289
00:16:48,492 --> 00:16:52,610
What is my sister doing there,
and why are the drapes shut?

290
00:16:55,012 --> 00:16:56,809
Okay. Rach, calm down, okay?

291
00:16:57,052 --> 00:16:59,725
She's really upset.
We're just talking.

292
00:16:59,972 --> 00:17:03,203
She's making something happen
with you to get back at me.

293
00:17:03,452 --> 00:17:06,205
That's the only reason
she could be here, huh?

294
00:17:06,452 --> 00:17:09,524
It couldn't be that maybe
I'm a good listener. . .

295
00:17:09,772 --> 00:17:12,889
. . .and I put on a great slide show?

296
00:17:15,292 --> 00:17:20,207
Ross, I am telling you,
she is using you to get back at me.

297
00:17:20,452 --> 00:17:25,003
I think I can take care of myself.
I'll talk to you later. Goodbye.

298
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:32,526
That was your sister, actually.

299
00:17:32,772 --> 00:17:34,888
She thinks you're just using me.

300
00:17:35,692 --> 00:17:36,522
So?

301
00:17:42,612 --> 00:17:44,523
-Hey.
-Hey.

302
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,605
I just came from the company
Ursula works for.

303
00:17:47,852 --> 00:17:50,412
Oh, no, not you too?

304
00:17:51,092 --> 00:17:54,528
I went to get Phoebe Buffay's checks.
There were a lot of them.

305
00:17:55,572 --> 00:17:57,244
Nice!

306
00:17:57,492 --> 00:17:59,847
And I won't have to
go back there anymore. . .

307
00:18:00,092 --> 00:18:03,129
. . .because I gave them
my "correct address. "

308
00:18:04,812 --> 00:18:08,487
Isn't it gonna bother you
that people think you're a porn star?

309
00:18:08,732 --> 00:18:11,007
Oh, no, I know how to handle it.

310
00:18:11,252 --> 00:18:12,605
-Good.
-Yeah.

311
00:18:14,492 --> 00:18:16,528
Trying to figure out how you know me?

312
00:18:16,772 --> 00:18:19,411
I'll give you a hint. From porn!

313
00:18:20,212 --> 00:18:24,205
Yeah, your pervert boyfriend
watched me in a porno movie!

314
00:18:28,092 --> 00:18:29,411
-See?
-Yeah.

315
00:18:33,052 --> 00:18:34,201
Hey.

316
00:18:34,732 --> 00:18:36,768
You may have been right about Jill.

317
00:18:37,012 --> 00:18:38,809
I knew it! What happened?

318
00:18:39,812 --> 00:18:40,881
She kissed me.

319
00:18:41,132 --> 00:18:43,088
What? You kissed?

320
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,602
Maybe we should
give them some privacy. . . .

321
00:18:48,372 --> 00:18:50,647
Look, I tried not to kiss her, okay?

322
00:18:50,892 --> 00:18:54,009
Doesn't sound like it.
It's easy not to kiss someone.

323
00:18:54,212 --> 00:18:57,363
You just don't. Look at us
right now, not kissing!

324
00:18:58,612 --> 00:19:01,809
Let me finish, okay?
She started kissing me. . .

325
00:19:02,012 --> 00:19:03,843
. . .and I didn't stop it.

326
00:19:04,092 --> 00:19:05,730
I guess I just wasn't thinking.

327
00:19:05,972 --> 00:19:08,850
Yeah. Let me give you
something to think about.

328
00:19:09,092 --> 00:19:14,007
Hold on! But then I started
thinking and I stopped the kissing.

329
00:19:14,332 --> 00:19:19,087
Thank you for taking your tongue out
of my sister's mouth to tell me that.

330
00:19:22,212 --> 00:19:25,045
I realized if anything happened
with me and Jill. . .

331
00:19:25,292 --> 00:19:28,409
. . .then nothing could ever
happen with us.

332
00:19:29,652 --> 00:19:31,404
-What?
-No, I mean. . . .

333
00:19:31,652 --> 00:19:35,122
I don't know if anything
is ever going to happen with us. . .

334
00:19:35,372 --> 00:19:37,408
. . .again, ever.

335
00:19:38,492 --> 00:19:41,564
But I don't want to know
that it never could.

336
00:19:41,892 --> 00:19:43,564
So I stopped it. . .

337
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,611
. . .and she got mad
and broke my projector.

338
00:19:54,372 --> 00:19:55,600
Wow.

339
00:19:57,892 --> 00:19:59,928
I don't even know what to say.

340
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:06,004
Thank you.

341
00:20:07,852 --> 00:20:09,410
You're welcome.

342
00:20:15,812 --> 00:20:17,564
My God, are you crying?

343
00:20:17,812 --> 00:20:21,088
I just don't see why those two
can't work things out!

344
00:20:26,652 --> 00:20:28,131
All right, I'm leaving.

345
00:20:28,372 --> 00:20:31,808
I'm not spending one more day with
someone who's out to sabotage me.

346
00:20:32,012 --> 00:20:33,081
That's you, Rachel.

347
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:35,201
Yeah, I got that.

348
00:20:35,972 --> 00:20:38,008
And you! I throw myself at you. . .

349
00:20:38,212 --> 00:20:40,772
. . .and you say no? How gay are you?

350
00:20:45,492 --> 00:20:47,369
You take care, Jill.

351
00:20:47,892 --> 00:20:50,201
-Okay, see you.
-Bye-bye.

352
00:20:51,772 --> 00:20:53,888
I can't believe Jill's gone.

353
00:20:56,612 --> 00:20:59,001
I can't help it, I opened a gate!



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
