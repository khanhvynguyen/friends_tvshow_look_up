3
00:00:48,986 --> 00:00:50,465
So, honey. . .

4
00:00:51,466 --> 00:00:53,696
. . .this threesome thing?

5
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:56,782
How are we even gonna find--?

6
00:00:57,026 --> 00:01:00,575
Actually, I'm making a list of women
I know who might be into this.

7
00:01:09,626 --> 00:01:10,422
Boy.

8
00:01:12,626 --> 00:01:14,821
Someone's been
doin' their homework.

9
00:01:16,226 --> 00:01:18,296
I know Gail Rosten
is in there twice. . .

10
00:01:18,466 --> 00:01:19,694
. . .but she is so. . . .

11
00:01:19,906 --> 00:01:21,703
Oh, I know.

12
00:01:23,586 --> 00:01:27,295
You know, just talkin' about it
is gettin' me kind of. . . .

13
00:01:27,586 --> 00:01:29,224
I know. Me too.

14
00:01:29,746 --> 00:01:31,179
I think Ben's asleep.

15
00:01:34,146 --> 00:01:38,662
You know, I think it'll be
better if we just save it.

16
00:01:41,866 --> 00:01:43,936
Right. Save it.
I can do that.

17
00:01:55,066 --> 00:01:55,816
How's it going?

18
00:01:56,066 --> 00:01:59,422
I've got to get out of this bed.
I'm going crazy here! Crazy!

19
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:01,180
Here you go, sweetie.

20
00:02:01,346 --> 00:02:04,383
What the hell is this, herbal tea?
I hate herbal tea.

21
00:02:05,706 --> 00:02:07,537
Well, I put some honey in it.

22
00:02:10,826 --> 00:02:14,341
-She doesn't know she was fired?
-No, the doctors say it may kill her.

23
00:02:14,506 --> 00:02:16,576
What are you two girls
whispering about over there?

24
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:21,022
But I think we should tell her.

25
00:02:26,226 --> 00:02:28,376
I mean, it's just so realistic.

26
00:02:28,546 --> 00:02:30,025
I know.

27
00:02:30,426 --> 00:02:31,620
His name's Pat.

28
00:02:31,866 --> 00:02:33,424
Pat the dog.

29
00:02:34,626 --> 00:02:35,741
I get it!

30
00:02:43,346 --> 00:02:44,495
Ready for a refill?

31
00:02:44,866 --> 00:02:46,345
I probably shouldn't.

32
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:48,021
So I will!

33
00:02:53,906 --> 00:02:56,181
-It's like it's raining.
-Pretty cool, huh?

34
00:02:56,346 --> 00:02:59,577
But if you think a fish wouldn't get
sucked into the mechanism. . .

35
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,498
. . .well, you'd be wrong.

36
00:03:03,426 --> 00:03:05,144
Can I use your bathroom?

37
00:03:05,306 --> 00:03:06,659
It's right through there.

38
00:03:09,506 --> 00:03:11,303
You know, I gotta tell you.

39
00:03:11,466 --> 00:03:13,297
If someone told me a week ago. . .

40
00:03:13,506 --> 00:03:16,816
. . .that I would be peeing
in Joey Tribbiani's apartment. . . .

41
00:03:16,986 --> 00:03:18,465
Life's pretty great, isn't it?

42
00:03:21,306 --> 00:03:23,103
I hope you're hungry.

43
00:03:23,346 --> 00:03:25,257
We're starting with oysters.

44
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:28,460
You know what they say about oysters,
don't you?

45
00:03:29,306 --> 00:03:30,625
They have parasites?

46
00:03:34,186 --> 00:03:37,781
Some people say that oysters
are an aphrodisiac.

47
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:40,499
-What people?
-People.

48
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,338
People say it.

49
00:03:43,626 --> 00:03:44,900
Come here.

50
00:03:48,146 --> 00:03:49,215
So, oysters, huh?

51
00:03:50,906 --> 00:03:53,500
Then we'll have a little
Middle Eastern couscous.

52
00:03:53,706 --> 00:03:55,139
Something we can eat. . .

53
00:03:55,306 --> 00:03:56,739
. . .with our hands.

54
00:03:57,466 --> 00:03:59,536
When we were studying
communicable diseases--

55
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,060
It's sensual.

56
00:04:04,146 --> 00:04:05,295
Didn't know. Okay.

57
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,940
Sorry, it's the hospital.

58
00:04:11,506 --> 00:04:13,462
The food looks great.
Save me some?

59
00:04:13,826 --> 00:04:15,703
I can't promise anything.

60
00:04:25,066 --> 00:04:26,977
We're really gonna do this?

61
00:04:28,746 --> 00:04:29,781
Looks like it.

62
00:04:31,106 --> 00:04:34,985
If this is too weird for you,
you can still back out--

63
00:04:35,306 --> 00:04:36,534
I got it!

64
00:04:42,146 --> 00:04:43,374
Thank you so much for coming.

65
00:04:43,546 --> 00:04:45,218
I wouldn't have missed it
for the world.

66
00:04:48,146 --> 00:04:49,465
I'm Ross, by the way.

67
00:04:49,746 --> 00:04:50,735
Hello, Ross.

68
00:04:52,946 --> 00:04:56,143
-I love what you've done with the space.
-Thank you so much.

69
00:04:59,506 --> 00:05:01,098
How hot is this?!

70
00:05:07,226 --> 00:05:09,217
I'm sorry you're here with me instead
of Roger.

71
00:05:09,386 --> 00:05:10,421
Yeah, me too.

72
00:05:12,586 --> 00:05:14,781
Well, I could make it seem like he's
here.

73
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:19,102
"Here's some little-known facts
about couscous:

74
00:05:19,306 --> 00:05:22,582
They didn't add the second 'cous'
until 1 979. "

75
00:05:25,706 --> 00:05:27,219
Stop it! That's not funny!

76
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:30,418
I'm sorry, okay?
It's just. . .

77
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:33,897
. . .tonight was supposed to be a big deal.

78
00:05:34,226 --> 00:05:36,786
-What was tonight?
-You don't want to know.

79
00:05:39,946 --> 00:05:41,140
What was tonight?

80
00:05:44,186 --> 00:05:46,700
Tonight was going to be
my first time.

81
00:05:46,866 --> 00:05:48,060
With Roger?

82
00:05:50,466 --> 00:05:52,184
Not just with Roger?

83
00:05:52,426 --> 00:05:53,415
Oh, my God.

84
00:05:53,866 --> 00:05:56,539
All right, relax,
Mr. I've-Had-Sex-Four-Times!

85
00:05:59,146 --> 00:06:01,182
Four different women!

86
00:06:01,346 --> 00:06:03,496
I've had sex way more times.

87
00:06:03,826 --> 00:06:04,702
How many?

88
00:06:05,546 --> 00:06:06,535
Nine.

89
00:06:09,186 --> 00:06:11,461
I'm just waiting for the perfect guy.

90
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:15,022
Good for you. You really think
Roger's the perfect guy?

91
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,180
No, but he's not a horrible guy.

92
00:06:18,786 --> 00:06:20,742
That's what I tell girls about me.

93
00:06:21,906 --> 00:06:23,737
Chandler, I'm gonna die a virgin!

94
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,621
No, you are sweet and wonderful. . .

95
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,424
. . .and it'll happen for you.

96
00:06:28,586 --> 00:06:31,225
Oh, really? When?
Do you want to do it with me?

97
00:06:36,306 --> 00:06:37,341
I was kidding.

98
00:06:38,306 --> 00:06:39,659
So was l.

99
00:06:47,466 --> 00:06:49,297
You're such an amazing actor.

100
00:06:51,186 --> 00:06:54,861
How do you know where
Dr. Drake Ramoray leaves off. . .

101
00:06:55,186 --> 00:06:57,416
. . .and Joey Tribbiani begins?

102
00:06:58,186 --> 00:07:00,416
Well, with Dr. Drake. . .

103
00:07:01,146 --> 00:07:03,501
. . .they always tell me what to say.

104
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:09,903
And with Joey, I pretty much have to
make it up on my own.

105
00:07:12,586 --> 00:07:13,621
Tell me something.

106
00:07:17,346 --> 00:07:20,065
-I just fell right off the couch there.
-Yeah, you did.

107
00:07:21,146 --> 00:07:23,706
Here you go.
Let me ask you a question.

108
00:07:25,906 --> 00:07:27,658
When was the last time. . .

109
00:07:27,986 --> 00:07:31,103
. . .someone told you
just how beautiful you are?

110
00:07:31,586 --> 00:07:32,621
Wow.

111
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:34,983
I can't feel my hands.

112
00:07:36,546 --> 00:07:38,184
Come on. Come here.

113
00:08:07,506 --> 00:08:08,905
We can't do this.

114
00:08:10,946 --> 00:08:12,299
Oyster?

115
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,942
If we did do this,
there'd be a lot of pressure on me.

116
00:08:18,186 --> 00:08:22,179
Because you've waited a long time,
and I wouldn't want to disappoint you.

117
00:08:22,346 --> 00:08:24,302
But I have nothing to compare it to.

118
00:08:24,466 --> 00:08:26,900
Even if you were horrible,
how would I know?

119
00:08:28,346 --> 00:08:30,177
I do like that.

120
00:08:30,746 --> 00:08:33,465
It's harder for me.
I have four women to compete with.

121
00:08:34,066 --> 00:08:36,500
Well, if it helps,
there were only three.

122
00:08:37,626 --> 00:08:39,184
So it'd just be for tonight?

123
00:08:39,346 --> 00:08:42,622
Absolutely. It would just be one
friend helping out another friend.

124
00:08:42,946 --> 00:08:45,096
Stop it. We're not doing this.

125
00:08:45,506 --> 00:08:46,621
-Let's do it!
-No!

126
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:47,815
Okay!

127
00:08:51,386 --> 00:08:53,342
Do you have any moves?

128
00:08:56,866 --> 00:08:58,379
I have some moves.

129
00:08:59,426 --> 00:09:00,700
I have no moves.

130
00:09:02,986 --> 00:09:04,214
Whatcha doing there?

131
00:09:06,106 --> 00:09:08,745
-I'm sorry, this is just too weird.
-Yeah, forget it.

132
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,497
What if I turn out the lights?

133
00:09:22,386 --> 00:09:24,263
That's the couch.

134
00:09:28,586 --> 00:09:30,497
Oh, my God!

135
00:09:31,786 --> 00:09:33,139
I know!

136
00:09:34,466 --> 00:09:35,819
I'll tell you something.

137
00:09:36,106 --> 00:09:38,301
We are gonna do that again!

138
00:09:52,106 --> 00:09:53,300
Morning.

139
00:09:54,986 --> 00:09:55,896
Oh, right.

140
00:09:57,706 --> 00:09:59,264
Oh, God.

141
00:10:00,106 --> 00:10:04,019
Oh, I can't believe Joey Tribbiani
heard me throw up.

142
00:10:05,066 --> 00:10:07,341
He actually saw you a little bit too.

143
00:10:10,186 --> 00:10:12,302
Oh, God, we didn't. . .?

144
00:10:14,546 --> 00:10:16,218
Not after seeing that.

145
00:10:17,946 --> 00:10:20,221
God, I'm just a horrible person.

146
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:21,496
Well, why?

147
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,145
Because I'm married.

148
00:10:23,426 --> 00:10:25,144
That's right, I'm a married woman.

149
00:10:25,306 --> 00:10:28,298
I came to a TV star's apartment
to have an affair.

150
00:10:29,626 --> 00:10:31,218
That's ridiculous.

151
00:10:31,546 --> 00:10:33,298
I'm not a "star. "

152
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:37,065
I'm just a regular famous actor.

153
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:41,703
And I'm a horrible, horrible person.

154
00:10:41,946 --> 00:10:44,096
Rachel, will you stop saying that?

155
00:10:44,746 --> 00:10:45,781
Hey, look.

156
00:10:46,186 --> 00:10:49,815
Remember on the show
when Capri was dying?

157
00:10:50,146 --> 00:10:52,376
-And she gave me--
-The ring from the cave.

158
00:11:00,066 --> 00:11:02,705
Oh, my God!
They let you keep that stuff?

159
00:11:02,986 --> 00:11:06,456
Sure. As long as they don't find out,
you can keep whatever you want.

160
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:08,940
And I want you to have it.

161
00:11:09,306 --> 00:11:10,785
No, I couldn't.

162
00:11:11,026 --> 00:11:12,664
Every time you look at it. . .

163
00:11:12,826 --> 00:11:16,182
. . .I want you to remember
that you are a good person.

164
00:11:16,386 --> 00:11:18,377
Now, you had the chance to cheat. . .

165
00:11:19,706 --> 00:11:21,025
. . .and with me.

166
00:11:22,386 --> 00:11:26,345
But you didn't.
And that's what this ring stands for.

167
00:11:27,146 --> 00:11:30,218
But I thought that ring stood for
Capri's undying love for her brother.

168
00:11:30,386 --> 00:11:32,104
Look, you want the ring or not?

169
00:11:37,986 --> 00:11:40,102
Hey, look at you! You're up!

170
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,219
I thought I'd try to take a walk.

171
00:11:42,386 --> 00:11:44,297
Will you pour me some water?
I'll be back soon.

172
00:11:44,826 --> 00:11:47,101
You're not gonna call work, are you?

173
00:11:47,346 --> 00:11:49,177
No. I've learned my lesson.

174
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,418
Let's go! Come on!
Move it!

175
00:11:55,986 --> 00:11:57,385
Phoebe, come on!

176
00:11:57,626 --> 00:12:01,096
Shoes, briefcase. Thanks, Lou.
Good luck with the gallbladder.

177
00:12:07,346 --> 00:12:08,495
Hey, Joe. . .

178
00:12:09,386 --> 00:12:11,104
. . .did you ever have a threesome?

179
00:12:14,586 --> 00:12:18,659
Look, Ross. Carol's great, and I'm sure
you're a very attractive man, but. . . .

180
00:12:20,386 --> 00:12:22,980
No. The reason I'm asking is that. . .

181
00:12:25,626 --> 00:12:27,582
. . .I sort of had one last night.

182
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,179
You?

183
00:12:30,706 --> 00:12:33,095
All right. So? Was it amazing?

184
00:12:33,266 --> 00:12:34,585
It was. . .

185
00:12:34,986 --> 00:12:36,180
. . .okay.

186
00:12:37,746 --> 00:12:39,896
Just okay? Did you do it right?

187
00:12:40,786 --> 00:12:45,223
Look, it's just, did you ever
go to a party and think:

188
00:12:45,386 --> 00:12:49,015
"Would anyone really miss me
if I weren't here?"

189
00:12:52,466 --> 00:12:53,899
But still, Ross.

190
00:12:54,706 --> 00:12:59,097
Your worst day with two women,
pretty much better than any other day.

191
00:13:05,266 --> 00:13:06,221
It's just. . .

192
00:13:06,906 --> 00:13:09,943
. . .my part seemed to be over
pretty quickly. . .

193
00:13:10,186 --> 00:13:12,541
. . .and then there was
a lot of waiting around.

194
00:13:14,906 --> 00:13:16,817
But you got to be with both of them.

195
00:13:17,986 --> 00:13:19,704
Not really.

196
00:13:21,626 --> 00:13:22,900
Just Carol.

197
00:13:23,066 --> 00:13:25,944
-Not the other one?
-No, she kept kicking me away.

198
00:13:26,746 --> 00:13:28,099
You don't want that.

199
00:13:29,786 --> 00:13:31,777
At least you got to
see a lot of stuff.

200
00:13:31,946 --> 00:13:34,779
Oh, I saw a lot of stuff.

201
00:13:37,026 --> 00:13:38,937
-You get a little bored?
-A little.

202
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:41,985
Made a snack.

203
00:13:43,546 --> 00:13:46,697
-What'd you have?
-Just a sandwich.

204
00:13:46,946 --> 00:13:49,301
Turkey. A little mustard.

205
00:13:49,546 --> 00:13:51,423
-Sounds good.
-It really was.

206
00:13:58,066 --> 00:14:01,502
Let me tell you about this chick
I scored with last night.

207
00:14:02,066 --> 00:14:04,182
Wait a minute, that was you.

208
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,820
Hey, check me out. I'm a slut!

209
00:14:11,146 --> 00:14:12,784
So you want to do something tonight?

210
00:14:12,946 --> 00:14:15,176
I can't.
Dr. Roger's coming over.

211
00:14:17,986 --> 00:14:19,180
Oh, right.

212
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:22,657
Because you're still seeing him,
and he's a good guy.

213
00:14:22,826 --> 00:14:23,975
I remember a time. . . .

214
00:14:26,226 --> 00:14:27,215
Are you okay?

215
00:14:27,426 --> 00:14:28,654
Yeah, totally.

216
00:14:29,306 --> 00:14:30,261
Totally. Are you?

217
00:14:30,506 --> 00:14:32,224
Great. It's so amazing.

218
00:14:32,386 --> 00:14:35,583
Last time Dr. Roger came over,
I was so nervous.

219
00:14:35,746 --> 00:14:39,534
But after being with you,
I'm like, "Can the doctor see me now?"

220
00:14:40,306 --> 00:14:41,534
I bet he can.

221
00:14:41,786 --> 00:14:45,142
"I don't have an appointment,
but I sure could use a physical. "

222
00:14:49,506 --> 00:14:52,896
-You sure you're okay?
-Don't worry about me, I'll be fine.

223
00:15:04,306 --> 00:15:05,785
My God! Barry!

224
00:15:05,986 --> 00:15:08,500
You said you'd be away all weekend!

225
00:15:09,306 --> 00:15:12,218
That's right! I'm sorry!
I am early!

226
00:15:12,386 --> 00:15:14,377
Finish, please!

227
00:15:19,826 --> 00:15:22,704
Surprise! Look who's back!

228
00:15:25,386 --> 00:15:26,660
Call security.

229
00:15:26,986 --> 00:15:29,500
Pheebs, didn't you get fired?

230
00:15:29,946 --> 00:15:31,265
I don't think so.

231
00:15:35,186 --> 00:15:37,746
-What are you doing here?
-All better. Back to work.

232
00:15:37,906 --> 00:15:39,942
This clown from research
told me I was fired.

233
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,097
He should do his research, huh?

234
00:15:43,186 --> 00:15:45,017
Well, you were fired.

235
00:15:48,226 --> 00:15:50,535
I told that guy
who answered your phone.

236
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:53,296
I didn't get that message.
So this doesn't count.

237
00:15:53,466 --> 00:15:55,058
Anyway, I'll be in my office.

238
00:15:55,586 --> 00:15:57,781
Phoebe, you don't have an office.

239
00:15:58,506 --> 00:16:00,144
I'll work right here.

240
00:16:00,306 --> 00:16:02,661
This is good. Next to this plant.

241
00:16:04,866 --> 00:16:06,424
You're in my office.

242
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:11,820
I've made a lot of cash for this
company. I am talking big bucks!

243
00:16:12,146 --> 00:16:15,422
Pesos! Yen! Rubles!
You make one little mistake--

244
00:16:15,586 --> 00:16:17,463
You lost 1 3 million dollars.

245
00:16:17,626 --> 00:16:19,503
So now this is all about money?

246
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,662
You know, it's bad enough that. . . .

247
00:16:23,186 --> 00:16:25,142
You have got to be kidding.

248
00:16:25,906 --> 00:16:28,943
-Are you all right?
-I'm having another heart attack.

249
00:16:29,186 --> 00:16:31,541
I'm having another heart attack!

250
00:16:31,706 --> 00:16:33,458
Call 91 1 !

251
00:16:34,266 --> 00:16:35,142
Dumb-ass!

252
00:16:38,106 --> 00:16:39,619
Pheebs, how's it going?

253
00:16:39,786 --> 00:16:42,141
They fired me, and I'm having
a heart attack.

254
00:16:42,306 --> 00:16:43,864
Well, welcome back.

255
00:16:49,746 --> 00:16:50,735
Is Joey Tribbiani here?

256
00:16:52,506 --> 00:16:55,976
If you see him, please tell him
I'm looking for him. . .

257
00:16:56,146 --> 00:16:59,297
. . .and that this time
I am not gonna throw up!

258
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:02,022
Are you okay?

259
00:17:02,186 --> 00:17:03,665
Me? I'm great!

260
00:17:03,826 --> 00:17:06,420
I'm fine! I'm so good!

261
00:17:07,306 --> 00:17:09,103
But you know who's not great?

262
00:17:09,426 --> 00:17:10,415
Men!

263
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,019
You're a man, right, Ross?

264
00:17:12,226 --> 00:17:13,454
Sit down.

265
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,896
Let me ask you something.

266
00:17:17,386 --> 00:17:21,174
Do wedding vows mean squat
to you people?

267
00:17:22,826 --> 00:17:25,545
Why is it that the second
we go out of town. . .

268
00:17:25,706 --> 00:17:29,142
. . .bam, there you are in bed
with the neighbor's dog-walker?

269
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,224
We're sorry.

270
00:17:35,186 --> 00:17:39,941
No, seriously. Seriously. What has
happened to the sanctity of marriage?

271
00:17:41,106 --> 00:17:44,860
-Didn't you spend last night at Joey's?
-What are you, a detective?

272
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:49,860
I don't know what's going on
with you and your husband. . .

273
00:17:50,026 --> 00:17:52,938
. . .and what is hopefully
an adult dog-walker.

274
00:17:54,746 --> 00:17:57,977
Look, can I just say,
not all men are like that.

275
00:17:58,226 --> 00:18:01,423
There are men who'll do anything
to make their marriage work.

276
00:18:01,586 --> 00:18:04,100
Men who will stand by and watch. . .

277
00:18:04,306 --> 00:18:08,697
. . .as their wives engage in what can
only be described as a "twosome" . . .

278
00:18:08,946 --> 00:18:12,177
. . .with some woman she barely knows
from the gym!

279
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,223
Who are these men?

280
00:18:15,586 --> 00:18:17,702
Just men. A guy I know.

281
00:18:18,106 --> 00:18:21,621
Well, you might want to tell him
it sounds like his wife. . .

282
00:18:21,906 --> 00:18:23,305
. . .is gay.

283
00:18:23,946 --> 00:18:25,265
She is not. . . .

284
00:18:30,186 --> 00:18:31,983
She's gay.

285
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:36,145
Oh, my God.

286
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,016
She is so gay!

287
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,657
I can't believe this.

288
00:18:46,306 --> 00:18:48,774
Good day for married people, huh?

289
00:18:51,226 --> 00:18:53,217
I'm sorry your husband cheated on you.

290
00:18:53,586 --> 00:18:55,861
I'm sorry your wife is gay.

291
00:18:57,826 --> 00:18:59,862
I guess women aren't that great either.

292
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:01,744
Try telling my wife that.

293
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:08,496
Okay to come in?

294
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,816
Come in, eat, whatever you want.

295
00:19:10,986 --> 00:19:12,942
Dr. Roger got beeped again.

296
00:19:13,106 --> 00:19:15,540
Yeah, I know. Guess who beeped him?

297
00:19:18,266 --> 00:19:20,018
I'm the ruptured spleen.

298
00:19:22,226 --> 00:19:23,420
Why would you do that?

299
00:19:23,586 --> 00:19:25,656
Because you shouldn't be with him.

300
00:19:29,146 --> 00:19:30,545
You should be with me.

301
00:19:32,906 --> 00:19:33,816
Really?

302
00:19:33,986 --> 00:19:37,376
When you were talking about Roger,
that was killing me.

303
00:19:37,626 --> 00:19:40,015
Things like last night
don't just happen.

304
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:44,054
At least not to me. I mean,
with the other two women. . .

305
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:49,901
. . .in the morning, I couldn't wait
to go be with my friends.

306
00:19:50,066 --> 00:19:51,704
But with you. . .

307
00:19:54,386 --> 00:19:57,025
. . .I was, you know,
already with a friend.

308
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,420
You probably don't want
to go out with me.

309
00:20:01,586 --> 00:20:05,261
I make too many jokes, I've never
been in a serious relationship. . .

310
00:20:05,426 --> 00:20:07,735
. . .and I'm not technically a "doctor. "

311
00:20:15,706 --> 00:20:17,822
There was just one woman,
wasn't there?

312
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,099
No, there were two.

313
00:20:20,346 --> 00:20:21,415
Including me?

314
00:20:27,866 --> 00:20:32,542
It only takes two heart attacks
To finally make you see

315
00:20:32,786 --> 00:20:36,745
One of them won 't do it
But the second will set you free

316
00:20:39,986 --> 00:20:44,537
Tell all your hate and anger
It's time to say goodbye

317
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:46,936
And that is just what I will do

318
00:20:47,186 --> 00:20:49,939
Soon as those bastards I worked for
Die!



9999
