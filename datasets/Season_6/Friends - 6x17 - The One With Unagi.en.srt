1
00:00:06,012 --> 00:00:08,526
Remember when I had a monkey?

2
00:00:09,212 --> 00:00:10,930
What was I thinking?

3
00:00:12,572 --> 00:00:17,009
Hey, so, what's with the 20 percent
tip? Did I do something wrong?

4
00:00:18,412 --> 00:00:20,289
20 percent is a pretty generous tip.

5
00:00:20,572 --> 00:00:22,563
You know what's more generous?
50 percent!

6
00:00:24,332 --> 00:00:27,722
-You know what's even more generous?
-I see where you're going.

7
00:00:28,372 --> 00:00:29,805
What's up with the greed?

8
00:00:30,132 --> 00:00:31,360
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:31,612 --> 00:00:35,924
I have to get new headshots made,
and they're really expensive.

10
00:00:36,132 --> 00:00:37,724
I'm down to, like, three.

11
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:41,844
Actually, two, because one of them
I blackened some teeth.

12
00:00:42,092 --> 00:00:43,730
Why'd I do that?

13
00:00:44,532 --> 00:00:47,444
Isn't there something you can do
to earn extra money?

14
00:00:47,692 --> 00:00:50,411
Can't you pick up an extra shift here?

15
00:00:50,732 --> 00:00:53,690
Or, you know, I used to beg for money.

16
00:00:55,412 --> 00:00:58,529
It helps if you've got
a little of this going on.

17
00:00:59,172 --> 00:01:00,924
Wow! I still have it.

18
00:01:01,892 --> 00:01:05,168
Don't you have an audition today?
Maybe you'll get that job.

19
00:01:08,412 --> 00:01:09,527
Wait a minute.

20
00:01:09,732 --> 00:01:12,485
I used to get medical experiments
done on me.

21
00:01:13,612 --> 00:01:15,568
Finally, an explanation.

22
00:01:16,492 --> 00:01:19,529
I used to get paid for
all kinds of medical stuff.

23
00:01:19,772 --> 00:01:23,845
Let's see. . . . Well, I don't want
to donate sperm again.

24
00:01:24,092 --> 00:01:26,526
I really prefer doing that
at the home office.

25
00:01:27,092 --> 00:01:30,880
Maybe they want some of my blood
or spit or something, huh?

26
00:01:31,332 --> 00:01:32,367
-Joey?
-Yeah.

27
00:01:32,572 --> 00:01:35,882
What did I tell you
about talking while working?

28
00:01:36,092 --> 00:01:37,127
Do it?

29
00:01:38,212 --> 00:01:43,127
That guy's been waiting 1 0 minutes.
He's complained about you three times.

30
00:01:45,492 --> 00:01:46,720
Now, where was l?

31
00:01:49,172 --> 00:01:51,163
The One With Unagi

32
00:01:51,332 --> 00:01:52,321
English Subtitles by
Gelula/SDI

33
00:02:26,572 --> 00:02:27,766
What are you up to?

34
00:02:28,012 --> 00:02:30,970
We went to a self-defense class today.

35
00:02:31,172 --> 00:02:34,721
Kicking a guy in the crotch all
morning really takes it out of you.

36
00:02:35,212 --> 00:02:36,930
Takes it out of you?

37
00:02:38,532 --> 00:02:40,762
Now we can kick anybody's ass.

38
00:02:41,012 --> 00:02:43,128
After one class?
I don't think so.

39
00:02:43,692 --> 00:02:45,842
You want to see me self-defend myself?

40
00:02:46,092 --> 00:02:47,969
Pretend you're a predator.

41
00:02:48,212 --> 00:02:49,281
Go on, I dare you!

42
00:02:50,812 --> 00:02:54,521
Of course you can defend yourself from
an attack you know is coming.

43
00:02:54,732 --> 00:02:56,450
That's not enough.

44
00:02:56,692 --> 00:02:59,764
Look, I studied karate
for a long time.

45
00:03:01,212 --> 00:03:03,965
And there's a concept you
should be familiar with.

46
00:03:04,212 --> 00:03:08,251
It's what the Japanese call unagi.

47
00:03:10,092 --> 00:03:11,844
Isn't that a kind of sushi?

48
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:13,961
No, it's a concept.

49
00:03:14,172 --> 00:03:16,925
Yeah, it is.
It's freshwater eel.

50
00:03:17,532 --> 00:03:18,931
Maybe it means that too.

51
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:22,124
I would kill for
a salmon skin roll right now.

52
00:03:23,372 --> 00:03:25,408
Fine, get attacked.
I don't even care.

53
00:03:26,612 --> 00:03:30,207
Come on, Ross, we're sorry.
Please tell us what it is.

54
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:36,963
Unagi is a state of total awareness.

55
00:03:37,332 --> 00:03:39,846
Only by achieving true unagi...

56
00:03:40,092 --> 00:03:44,131
. . .can you be prepared for any danger
that may befall you.

57
00:03:45,012 --> 00:03:47,731
In case someone's trying
to steal your bamboo sleeping mat. . .

58
00:03:47,932 --> 00:03:49,729
. . .or your kettle of fish?

59
00:03:53,412 --> 00:03:57,769
It's one thing being prepared
for an attack against each other.

60
00:03:58,012 --> 00:04:02,528
Whole other story being prepared for
an, I don't know-- A surprise!

61
00:04:10,092 --> 00:04:11,525
You knew that was coming. . .

62
00:04:11,772 --> 00:04:15,526
. . .but that doesn't mean
you have unagi.

63
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:22,524
If we made reservations, we could have
unagi in a half-hour.

64
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:27,123
-Is Monica here?
-No.

65
00:04:27,332 --> 00:04:30,642
I need help. I don't know
what to get for Valentine's Day.

66
00:04:30,892 --> 00:04:35,408
Valentine's Day was two weeks ago,
so I wouldn't get her a calendar.

67
00:04:36,532 --> 00:04:39,524
She was working,
so we're celebrating tonight.

68
00:04:39,772 --> 00:04:43,731
Why don't you book a day for
both of you at those romantic spas?

69
00:04:43,932 --> 00:04:46,162
That's actually a good idea.

70
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:49,131
And, of course, crotchless panties.

71
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:54,406
Appealing as that sounds
to her boyfriend. . .

72
00:04:54,852 --> 00:04:56,524
. . .and her brother.

73
00:04:59,812 --> 00:05:02,565
We promised to make
each other gifts this year.

74
00:05:02,772 --> 00:05:04,046
-I love that.
-You guys!

75
00:05:04,372 --> 00:05:06,442
You can't make crotchless panties?

76
00:05:08,212 --> 00:05:09,804
You take scissors and cut--

77
00:05:10,012 --> 00:05:11,001
Okay, okay, okay.

78
00:05:12,252 --> 00:05:14,163
Making things sounds so much fun.

79
00:05:14,452 --> 00:05:17,489
I thought so, until I papier-mâchéd
one of my eyes shut.

80
00:05:18,052 --> 00:05:20,202
I love papier-mâché!
What did you make?

81
00:05:20,492 --> 00:05:22,244
I made a flar-lar-lar.

82
00:05:24,012 --> 00:05:25,240
-What is that?
-Nothing!

83
00:05:27,532 --> 00:05:28,760
So, what'll you do?

84
00:05:28,972 --> 00:05:31,645
Have you made anything
I can take credit for?

85
00:05:31,852 --> 00:05:35,208
I have, I have! I started making
little sock bunnies!

86
00:05:35,412 --> 00:05:37,243
Oh, for crying out loud!

87
00:05:39,252 --> 00:05:41,402
Wait a minute. That is my sock!

88
00:05:43,412 --> 00:05:45,607
Now it's your little bunny friend.

89
00:05:54,972 --> 00:05:56,166
Okay. . . .

90
00:06:01,252 --> 00:06:03,129
This actually is a flar-lar-lar.

91
00:06:06,972 --> 00:06:09,486
Can I ask about the
Valentine's Day gifts?

92
00:06:09,692 --> 00:06:12,126
-Yeah.
-Do we have to make the entire thing?

93
00:06:12,732 --> 00:06:14,848
Yes. Did you forget to make yours?

94
00:06:16,252 --> 00:06:17,685
Of course not.

95
00:06:18,852 --> 00:06:22,640
I just have to go to the place
where I made it and pick it up.

96
00:06:23,612 --> 00:06:26,922
I can't wait. It'll be
the best Valentine's Day ever!

97
00:06:28,892 --> 00:06:32,043
I can't believe it!
Make the presents!

98
00:06:33,132 --> 00:06:36,408
-What?
-Just so excited to make the presents!

99
00:06:44,492 --> 00:06:46,562
Hi, I'm Joey Tribbiani.

100
00:06:46,852 --> 00:06:49,491
With all due respect,
I'd like to donate some fluids.

101
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:55,690
We're at the end of a research cycle
and not looking for applicants now.

102
00:06:55,892 --> 00:06:58,406
That's too bad. I've been saving up.

103
00:07:02,332 --> 00:07:05,085
You sure there's no studies
I can participate in?

104
00:07:05,732 --> 00:07:08,326
-Here's a schedule of what's coming up.
-Thanks.

105
00:07:09,492 --> 00:07:10,720
This one starts now.

106
00:07:11,092 --> 00:07:14,926
Only identical twins are eligible.
It's a twin study.

107
00:07:15,252 --> 00:07:16,651
But it's $2000!

108
00:07:17,372 --> 00:07:18,805
Sorry.

109
00:07:20,972 --> 00:07:21,961
And this?

110
00:07:22,372 --> 00:07:27,162
"Testing the Effects of Joey Tribbiani
on Attractive Nurse Receptionists. "

111
00:07:28,572 --> 00:07:31,848
Results are back on that one.
They're not good.

112
00:07:36,092 --> 00:07:37,844
-That was good.
-Yeah.

113
00:07:38,052 --> 00:07:40,327
Danger! Danger!

114
00:07:44,412 --> 00:07:46,482
What the hell was that?

115
00:07:46,852 --> 00:07:50,049
A lesson in the importance of unagi.

116
00:07:53,212 --> 00:07:54,725
You're a freak!

117
00:07:55,812 --> 00:07:56,881
Perhaps.

118
00:07:58,612 --> 00:07:59,488
Now I'm curious.

119
00:07:59,732 --> 00:08:04,647
At what point during those girlish
screams would you have kicked my ass?

120
00:08:07,052 --> 00:08:09,646
All right, so we weren't prepared!

121
00:08:11,052 --> 00:08:14,647
I'm sorry I took drastic
measures to make my point.

122
00:08:14,892 --> 00:08:16,644
I just want you to be safe.

123
00:08:18,292 --> 00:08:19,566
Danger!

124
00:08:24,012 --> 00:08:25,286
Ah-ha!

125
00:08:25,652 --> 00:08:27,131
Unagi!

126
00:08:33,652 --> 00:08:35,768
2000 bucks is a lot of money.

127
00:08:36,212 --> 00:08:37,531
I wish I had a twin.

128
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:41,007
Where could I find someone...

129
00:08:41,212 --> 00:08:43,851
... who looks exactly like me?

130
00:09:04,772 --> 00:09:06,251
Chandler.

131
00:09:07,852 --> 00:09:10,127
I sensed it was you.

132
00:09:11,932 --> 00:09:13,160
What?

133
00:09:14,132 --> 00:09:15,360
Unagi.

134
00:09:16,332 --> 00:09:17,845
I'm always aware.

135
00:09:18,052 --> 00:09:20,930
Are you aware that unagi is an eel?

136
00:09:22,772 --> 00:09:25,332
-What's up?
-What should I make for Monica?

137
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:27,841
Why don't you make her
one of your little jokes?

138
00:09:28,092 --> 00:09:31,846
I'm going crazy.
Do you have anything homemade?

139
00:09:32,812 --> 00:09:35,087
You know what?
She'd love this.

140
00:09:35,292 --> 00:09:38,648
It's a replica of Apollo 8.
I made it in the sixth grade.

141
00:09:40,132 --> 00:09:43,920
I could use that. I could say,
"Your love sends me to the moon. "

142
00:09:44,132 --> 00:09:46,930
Except Apollo 8 didn't
actually land on the moon.

143
00:09:47,132 --> 00:09:52,001
You can write, "Your love lets me orbit
the moon twice and return safely. "

144
00:09:54,092 --> 00:09:55,605
I can't give this to her.

145
00:09:55,812 --> 00:09:58,690
-Why not?
-It says "Captain Ross" on the side.

146
00:10:00,452 --> 00:10:03,364
And it says, "I hate Monica"
on the bottom.

147
00:10:07,292 --> 00:10:08,520
Danger!

148
00:10:16,572 --> 00:10:18,642
Salmon skin roll.

149
00:10:38,732 --> 00:10:40,370
"Yes, honey, I made it myself. "

150
00:10:54,012 --> 00:10:55,968
I can't do it. I can't do it.

151
00:10:59,972 --> 00:11:02,532
A mixed tape! A mixed tape!

152
00:11:04,172 --> 00:11:06,640
Hi! Ready to exchange gifts?

153
00:11:06,892 --> 00:11:09,770
-Sure. You go first.
-Okay, come here.

154
00:11:09,972 --> 00:11:13,647
Okay, it's not wrapped
because I just finished it.

155
00:11:14,372 --> 00:11:18,001
But I made you a tape of what I think
are all romantic songs.

156
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:21,201
What a great gift!

157
00:11:23,772 --> 00:11:26,127
Is "The Way You Look Tonight" on it?

158
00:11:28,692 --> 00:11:30,603
We'll have to listen and see.

159
00:11:31,412 --> 00:11:34,131
Oh, I love it!
Thank you so much.

160
00:11:36,092 --> 00:11:37,605
You ready to open yours?

161
00:11:49,692 --> 00:11:50,920
It's a sock bunny.

162
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:53,689
Remember how I call you bunny?

163
00:11:54,612 --> 00:11:55,931
Not really.

164
00:11:57,372 --> 00:12:00,364
I did one time.
And I want to start doing it more.

165
00:12:01,372 --> 00:12:03,602
-That's what this is about.
-I see.

166
00:12:04,292 --> 00:12:06,089
Phoebe makes sock bunnies.

167
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:09,762
No, she doesn't.
What she makes, they're sock rabbits.

168
00:12:09,972 --> 00:12:12,406
They're completely different.
Okay, okay.

169
00:12:12,812 --> 00:12:14,370
I didn't make it!

170
00:12:14,612 --> 00:12:18,207
I forgot about tonight and that we're
supposed to make the presents.

171
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:19,681
It's okay.

172
00:12:20,092 --> 00:12:21,161
No, it's not okay.

173
00:12:21,412 --> 00:12:22,970
You're so incredible.

174
00:12:23,212 --> 00:12:26,921
You went through all this time
and effort to make this tape.

175
00:12:29,012 --> 00:12:30,809
I'll make this up to you.
I will.

176
00:12:31,052 --> 00:12:35,364
I am going to cook you
anything you want in here.

177
00:12:35,612 --> 00:12:39,730
And I'm going to do anything
you want in there.

178
00:12:41,692 --> 00:12:44,729
Well, I did put a lot of thought
into the tape.

179
00:12:58,532 --> 00:13:01,171
You are way too young
to have seen that.

180
00:13:02,492 --> 00:13:04,642
Your birthday's in a month and a half.

181
00:13:04,972 --> 00:13:08,248
What if I forget to get you
a present for that too?

182
00:13:08,572 --> 00:13:12,121
You are totally and completely
1 00 percent forgiven.

183
00:13:13,412 --> 00:13:14,765
We've got to wash that.

184
00:13:19,412 --> 00:13:22,563
Remember that jacket you loved
that was too expensive?

185
00:13:22,812 --> 00:13:24,723
You have done enough.

186
00:13:25,532 --> 00:13:27,284
I'll wake up early and get it.

187
00:13:27,492 --> 00:13:29,608
No-- Get it in black, not brown.

188
00:13:32,292 --> 00:13:33,805
Your cake is ready.

189
00:13:37,612 --> 00:13:41,321
It's like that old saying,
"Have sex, eat some cake. "

190
00:13:44,212 --> 00:13:46,885
Hey, Mon. Hey, Chan.
Just getting a soda.

191
00:13:51,892 --> 00:13:53,371
Who the hell are you?

192
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:55,566
I'm Joey.

193
00:13:56,532 --> 00:13:58,488
"How are you doing?"

194
00:14:00,412 --> 00:14:02,528
No! No! No! No! No!

195
00:14:03,012 --> 00:14:04,445
How "you" doing?

196
00:14:06,092 --> 00:14:09,528
How "you" doing?
Damn it, Carl! Go wait in the hall.

197
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,087
I've got to apologize
on behalf of Carl.

198
00:14:17,292 --> 00:14:19,328
Who the hell is Carl?

199
00:14:20,052 --> 00:14:21,246
Did I not mention?

200
00:14:22,412 --> 00:14:27,327
Carl is a guy I hired to be my twin
for a medical research project.

201
00:14:30,732 --> 00:14:34,008
Sometimes the good ideas are
right in front of you.

202
00:14:34,932 --> 00:14:39,130
It sounds crazy, but it might work.
The only problem is Carl's acting. . . .

203
00:14:39,372 --> 00:14:41,124
The only problem?

204
00:14:42,212 --> 00:14:45,921
He's the reason I didn't get that
big commercial two years ago.

205
00:14:46,132 --> 00:14:48,248
We were supposed to be brothers,
but he messed up.

206
00:14:49,572 --> 00:14:51,528
Can I get a piece of that cake?

207
00:14:51,972 --> 00:14:54,566
Pizza! We like pizza!
Get out!

208
00:15:02,172 --> 00:15:04,322
-Pat Sajak?
-Yep.

209
00:15:04,532 --> 00:15:06,409
-Alex Trebek?
-Of course.

210
00:15:06,652 --> 00:15:08,927
-Chuck Woolery?
-Definitely.

211
00:15:09,132 --> 00:15:13,967
You will not find a single game show
host whose ass I cannot kick.

212
00:15:23,092 --> 00:15:25,287
-Say it!
-Say we are unagi!

213
00:15:26,772 --> 00:15:29,764
It's not something you are,
it's something you have.

214
00:15:30,732 --> 00:15:31,721
Say it!

215
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:33,570
I could easily get out of this. . .

216
00:15:33,812 --> 00:15:37,487
. . .but there's a chance
you could get very, very hurt!

217
00:15:49,572 --> 00:15:53,770
Carl, we're next. Now remember,
what is this not gonna be?

218
00:15:54,012 --> 00:15:56,765
-Another Minute Maid fiasco.
-That's right.

219
00:15:57,012 --> 00:15:58,161
And what are you not gonna do?

220
00:15:58,372 --> 00:16:01,921
-I'm not gonna talk because--
-Damn it, Carl!

221
00:16:06,172 --> 00:16:07,924
Can I have the next one, please?

222
00:16:08,212 --> 00:16:09,327
Thank you.

223
00:16:09,812 --> 00:16:11,530
Joey and Tony Tribbiani.

224
00:16:11,932 --> 00:16:13,160
That's us.

225
00:16:13,412 --> 00:16:16,529
But this is a study
for identical twins.

226
00:16:16,772 --> 00:16:19,525
That's right. $2000.

227
00:16:20,692 --> 00:16:22,410
But you're not identical twins.

228
00:16:25,052 --> 00:16:26,724
Damn it, Carl!

229
00:16:33,012 --> 00:16:34,923
Oh, my good God.

230
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:40,682
Continuing the countdown of your
favorite meals.

231
00:16:41,012 --> 00:16:43,731
Tonight, number three:

232
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:47,329
Macaroni and cheese
with cut-up hot dogs.

233
00:16:49,252 --> 00:16:52,403
Look, you have done enough.
You have to stop this now.

234
00:16:52,652 --> 00:16:54,529
I will. But not tonight.

235
00:16:54,772 --> 00:16:58,731
For dinner music, I thought we could
listen to that tape that you made me.

236
00:16:59,132 --> 00:17:00,645
Oh, the mixed tape.

237
00:17:08,732 --> 00:17:11,565
"The Way You Look Tonight" is on here.

238
00:17:11,812 --> 00:17:13,006
Dance with me.

239
00:17:31,132 --> 00:17:33,851
You are just the sweetest.

240
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:40,887
I love the way you look every night,
Chandler.

241
00:17:45,612 --> 00:17:47,568
That's why I made you this tape.

242
00:17:47,772 --> 00:17:51,845
Happy birthday!
Love, Janice!

243
00:17:57,292 --> 00:17:58,930
No, you're the sweetest.

244
00:18:05,092 --> 00:18:07,652
Okay, ladies, that ends today's class.

245
00:18:07,852 --> 00:18:09,365
Remember, be safe out there.

246
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,764
-Great class.
-Thanks.

247
00:18:18,012 --> 00:18:19,809
I was watching.

248
00:18:22,812 --> 00:18:25,724
A couple of questions:

249
00:18:25,932 --> 00:18:27,570
You know that last move. . .

250
00:18:27,812 --> 00:18:30,804
. . .where that woman tripped you
and pinned you to the floor?

251
00:18:31,052 --> 00:18:32,280
What would you do next?

252
00:18:32,492 --> 00:18:34,801
She'd take the keys
and jam them in your--

253
00:18:35,052 --> 00:18:37,885
No, no. What would you do next?

254
00:18:38,172 --> 00:18:40,925
-Who, me, the attacker?
-Yes, that's right.

255
00:18:42,052 --> 00:18:43,041
Why?

256
00:18:43,252 --> 00:18:46,608
I tried attacking two women.
Did not work.

257
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:47,881
What?

258
00:18:48,092 --> 00:18:50,242
No, it's okay.
They're my friends.

259
00:18:50,492 --> 00:18:53,689
In fact, I was married to one of them.

260
00:18:54,572 --> 00:18:56,927
You attacked your ex-wife?

261
00:18:57,132 --> 00:18:58,929
Oh, no. No, no.

262
00:18:59,132 --> 00:19:00,724
I tried.

263
00:19:02,212 --> 00:19:05,727
But I couldn't.
That's why I'm here.

264
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:08,401
Maybe we could attack them together!

265
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,211
That's a no.

266
00:19:13,772 --> 00:19:17,242
I am so, so, so, so sorry.

267
00:19:22,012 --> 00:19:24,731
And I will cook
anything you want in here.

268
00:19:24,972 --> 00:19:28,328
And do anything you want in there.

269
00:19:29,812 --> 00:19:32,724
Yeah, you will!
And are you kidding me?

270
00:19:35,212 --> 00:19:37,931
Come on, Monica,
it's our Valentine's Day.

271
00:19:38,172 --> 00:19:40,163
Please, please, please, please?

272
00:19:42,412 --> 00:19:43,401
Okay.

273
00:19:51,012 --> 00:19:53,810
My funny Valentine

274
00:19:54,372 --> 00:19:57,603
Sweet comic Valentine

275
00:19:58,812 --> 00:20:01,929
-So are we going in there?
-I am!

276
00:20:05,292 --> 00:20:08,523
Your looks are laughable

277
00:20:16,332 --> 00:20:18,721
Nowhere to run.

278
00:20:20,892 --> 00:20:23,452
I don't like sitting here.
I'm gonna go over--

279
00:20:23,692 --> 00:20:25,125
No, they got here first.

280
00:20:34,172 --> 00:20:36,367
-Why is Ross doing that?
-Danger!

281
00:20:36,612 --> 00:20:40,924
Oh, my God!
Why is he jumping on those women?

282
00:20:42,372 --> 00:20:44,328
We should help them.

283
00:20:44,612 --> 00:20:47,524
I don't think they need any help.
