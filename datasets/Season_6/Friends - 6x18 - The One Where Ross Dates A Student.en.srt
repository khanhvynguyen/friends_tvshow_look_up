1
00:00:02,852 --> 00:00:03,648
Hey.

2
00:00:03,892 --> 00:00:07,771
I just got my teacher evaluations.
Look what this student wrote.

3
00:00:07,972 --> 00:00:12,090
"I loved Dr. Geller's class.
Mind-blowing lectures.

4
00:00:12,332 --> 00:00:17,201
Dr. Geller, you are definitely the
hottie of the Paleontology Department. "

5
00:00:18,612 --> 00:00:22,651
"Hotties of Paleontology. "
There's a big-selling calendar, eh?

6
00:00:24,132 --> 00:00:27,681
-Who wrote it?
-The evaluations are all anonymous.

7
00:00:27,892 --> 00:00:29,848
-You still have their exams?
-Yeah.

8
00:00:30,052 --> 00:00:34,170
You could just match the handwriting
and, boom, there's your admirer.

9
00:00:36,052 --> 00:00:38,612
A hot girl's at stake,
and he becomes Rain Man.

10
00:00:40,292 --> 00:00:44,126
Wait a minute. Why are we
so sure that this is a girl?

11
00:00:48,252 --> 00:00:49,571
It's a girl!

12
00:00:50,412 --> 00:00:52,050
Anyway, it wouldn't matter, okay?

13
00:00:52,292 --> 00:00:55,489
Because I'm a teacher.
She's a student.

14
00:00:55,692 --> 00:00:57,967
-It's against the rules?
-It's frowned upon.

15
00:00:58,212 --> 00:01:01,284
-Besides, there's a big age difference.
-When you're 90--

16
00:01:01,532 --> 00:01:05,684
I know, she'll be 80 and it won't
seem like such a big difference.

17
00:01:07,132 --> 00:01:09,487
No, that's not what
I was gonna say at all.

18
00:01:11,132 --> 00:01:15,808
When you're 90, you'll still have the
memory of being with a 20-year-old.

19
00:01:18,052 --> 00:01:20,122
The One Where Ross Dates A Student

20
00:01:20,292 --> 00:01:21,281
English Subtitles by

21
00:01:54,852 --> 00:01:58,640
Chandler, you know your college friend
who became a movie director?

22
00:01:58,892 --> 00:02:02,248
Oh yeah, Dana Keystone.
She was in my movement class.

23
00:02:02,852 --> 00:02:07,721
-What's a movement class?
-He's pretending he didn't take mime.

24
00:02:08,332 --> 00:02:12,962
She's directing a new AI Pacino movie.
You gotta get me an audition.

25
00:02:13,172 --> 00:02:15,288
I haven't talked to her
in, like, 1 0 years.

26
00:02:15,492 --> 00:02:18,290
Please, Chandler,
I would owe you so much.

27
00:02:18,492 --> 00:02:21,564
You do owe me so much.
You owe me 3000--

28
00:02:21,772 --> 00:02:25,287
Hey, hey, dude. Why you changing
the subject? What?

29
00:02:25,532 --> 00:02:28,285
-Will you make the call?
-Okay, I'll try.

30
00:02:28,532 --> 00:02:33,447
Thanks. Last auditions are Thursday,
so I gotta get in by Thursday.

31
00:02:33,692 --> 00:02:36,286
Just remember Thursday.
Can you remember Thursday?

32
00:02:37,452 --> 00:02:38,601
Yeah, so Tuesday?

33
00:02:40,412 --> 00:02:41,208
Thursday!

34
00:02:42,332 --> 00:02:47,042
Just think of it like this:
The third day. Monday, one day.

35
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,123
Tuesday, two day.

36
00:02:49,452 --> 00:02:51,090
Wednesday. . . .
When, huh, what day?

37
00:02:51,332 --> 00:02:52,845
Thursday!

38
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:55,521
The third day, okay?

39
00:02:56,732 --> 00:02:58,165
-Thank you.
-Okay.

40
00:03:00,012 --> 00:03:03,368
-I'm gonna check my messages.
-You thought of that in there?

41
00:03:03,612 --> 00:03:06,251
Sure, nature called.
She wants to see who else did.

42
00:03:08,532 --> 00:03:09,851
Hello?

43
00:03:11,812 --> 00:03:12,881
Rachel.

44
00:03:13,132 --> 00:03:15,407
Someone is in our apartment.
Call the cops!

45
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,045
You're on the phone!

46
00:03:18,012 --> 00:03:20,480
-Oh, my God!
-What?

47
00:03:20,692 --> 00:03:22,045
Oh, my God! Thank you!

48
00:03:22,292 --> 00:03:24,408
Fire department put out
a fire at our place!

49
00:03:24,612 --> 00:03:28,890
-Oh, my God! How bad was it?
-It was a fire, I'm guessing not good.

50
00:03:29,452 --> 00:03:31,647
-Come on, we gotta go!
-Yeah, come on.

51
00:03:34,132 --> 00:03:36,248
What are you smiling about?

52
00:03:36,732 --> 00:03:40,884
The part I want to audition for is
a fireman. This is so meant to be!

53
00:03:49,092 --> 00:03:52,323
You were very generous
with your grades this semester.

54
00:03:58,892 --> 00:04:00,848
-Professor Geller?
-Yeah?

55
00:04:01,852 --> 00:04:05,811
-I really enjoyed your class.
-Oh, thank you. Thanks very much.

56
00:04:07,932 --> 00:04:11,368
I'm a little embarrassed about
calling you a "hottie. "

57
00:04:12,012 --> 00:04:13,604
-That was you?
-Yeah.

58
00:04:13,812 --> 00:04:17,407
I felt a little weird about it.
You're a teacher. I'm a student.

59
00:04:18,852 --> 00:04:20,649
Want to go out sometime?

60
00:04:22,732 --> 00:04:24,450
That's not the best idea.

61
00:04:24,652 --> 00:04:28,440
Oh, because I was thinking,
the semester's over.

62
00:04:28,692 --> 00:04:31,206
-You're not my teacher anymore.
-What time?

63
00:04:33,492 --> 00:04:35,642
Oh, you know what? Forget it.

64
00:04:35,852 --> 00:04:37,410
I see you already gave me an A.

65
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:41,765
-Gotcha.
-I'm kidding! God!

66
00:04:43,692 --> 00:04:45,887
So seriously, what time?

67
00:04:49,932 --> 00:04:53,083
Coming through. Coming through.
Oh! Hello. Hi.

68
00:04:53,692 --> 00:04:55,444
Right. Coming through!

69
00:04:56,052 --> 00:04:57,690
Okay. Well, it's not so bad.

70
00:04:57,932 --> 00:05:01,049
Most of the damage
was contained in the bedrooms.

71
00:05:01,252 --> 00:05:04,449
Hey, buddy, think I could borrow
your uniform this Thursday?

72
00:05:05,212 --> 00:05:08,045
-Excuse me?
-Joey! He's working.

73
00:05:08,532 --> 00:05:10,602
You would look good in that.

74
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,450
Oh, how bad is it?

75
00:05:13,652 --> 00:05:15,051
It's bad, it's really bad.

76
00:05:15,252 --> 00:05:20,042
The only thing that isn't burned is an
ax, which I do not remember buying.

77
00:05:20,812 --> 00:05:22,882
-How's your room?
-Everything's ruined.

78
00:05:23,132 --> 00:05:25,566
My bed, my clothes.
Look at my favorite sweater.

79
00:05:25,812 --> 00:05:26,688
Isn't that mine?

80
00:05:27,652 --> 00:05:30,120
Fine. I'm sorry for your loss.

81
00:05:31,452 --> 00:05:35,001
You won't be able to live here for
a while. You have a place to stay?

82
00:05:35,212 --> 00:05:37,089
Oh! Wow!

83
00:05:37,332 --> 00:05:40,290
Okay, look, pal. . .

84
00:05:40,732 --> 00:05:43,565
. . .I am not in the mood
to be hit on right now.

85
00:05:43,812 --> 00:05:46,770
But if you give me your number,
I'll call you sometime.

86
00:05:49,212 --> 00:05:51,203
Yes, they can stay with us.

87
00:05:51,412 --> 00:05:54,051
Do you know what
started the fire, Mr. Fireman?

88
00:05:55,292 --> 00:05:57,248
Well, do either of you smoke?

89
00:05:57,452 --> 00:06:00,762
No, not usually. But yeah,
I could use one now. Thanks.

90
00:06:00,972 --> 00:06:05,409
-Do you light candles, burn incense?
-Yes, I do all the time. I love them!

91
00:06:06,732 --> 00:06:10,691
Oh, my God, I did it! It's me,
it's me! I burned down the house!

92
00:06:10,932 --> 00:06:15,050
Okay, Phoebe, calm down.
There's no need to place blame. Okay?

93
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,442
I warned her about those candles.

94
00:06:20,972 --> 00:06:23,964
It's great to catch up.
I can't believe how long it's been.

95
00:06:24,212 --> 00:06:26,442
Hey, Chandler, is that. . .?

96
00:06:28,852 --> 00:06:31,320
-Oh, that's great, good for you.
-So, is it. . .?

97
00:06:33,732 --> 00:06:36,644
Okay. So, yeah, maybe
we can get together. . . .

98
00:06:42,732 --> 00:06:44,324
Can you hold on for one second?

99
00:06:44,812 --> 00:06:45,927
What?

100
00:06:46,132 --> 00:06:48,168
Do you want to get a pizza later?

101
00:06:49,692 --> 00:06:51,045
Hi, I'm back.

102
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:55,248
Yeah, that sounds great.
We'll do it then. Okay, bye.

103
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:01,928
When's my audition?
I know it's Thursday, but what time?

104
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:05,089
Hi. We didn't get to the audition.

105
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:07,760
I'm taking her to coffee.
We'll do it then.

106
00:07:08,012 --> 00:07:10,480
Now you're going on a date
with this girl?

107
00:07:10,692 --> 00:07:12,648
I haven't talked to her in 1 0 years.

108
00:07:12,892 --> 00:07:15,964
You can't just call up
and ask somebody for a favor.

109
00:07:16,212 --> 00:07:18,931
There are rules, you know?
You gotta put in some time.

110
00:07:19,132 --> 00:07:20,281
Right, I'm sorry.

111
00:07:20,532 --> 00:07:23,842
-It's not like she's an ex-girlfriend.
-We only went out once.

112
00:07:24,132 --> 00:07:25,645
You dated her?!

113
00:07:26,732 --> 00:07:28,245
Not once.

114
00:07:29,692 --> 00:07:33,765
Why don't I just go out with an ex,
you know, and do Joey a favor?

115
00:07:33,972 --> 00:07:37,089
You want to do Joey a favor?
Maybe you go out with Joey.

116
00:07:45,212 --> 00:07:48,443
That's great. My friend Joey's
in the movie business.

117
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:51,327
You know who I ran into from school?
Howie.

118
00:07:51,932 --> 00:07:53,843
My friend's name is Joey.

119
00:07:54,412 --> 00:07:56,687
Apparently, Howie's editing now.

120
00:07:56,932 --> 00:08:00,845
Yeah, he calls me up and asks me
if he can edit my new movie.

121
00:08:01,052 --> 00:08:02,326
Can you believe that?

122
00:08:02,532 --> 00:08:05,251
You know, I haven't spoken to him
in 1 0 years. . .

123
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:08,046
. . .and he asks me for a favor?

124
00:08:10,412 --> 00:08:12,642
Yeah, I've always hated that Howie.

125
00:08:13,412 --> 00:08:15,687
No "How you doing?"

126
00:08:15,932 --> 00:08:18,890
Man, I mean, not even
a cup of coffee first.

127
00:08:19,092 --> 00:08:20,844
-The nerve, huh?
-Yeah.

128
00:08:21,052 --> 00:08:22,326
Refill?

129
00:08:24,052 --> 00:08:27,249
This is last-minute, so I want
to apologize for the mess.

130
00:08:27,452 --> 00:08:28,248
Oh, who cares?

131
00:08:31,892 --> 00:08:35,521
Oh, my God! It sure didn't look
this way when I lived here.

132
00:08:35,732 --> 00:08:37,051
I know!

133
00:08:38,892 --> 00:08:43,044
But there's only room for one, so one
of you will have to stay at Joey's.

134
00:08:44,252 --> 00:08:48,086
Since the fire was kind of my fault,
you should get to stay here.

135
00:08:48,332 --> 00:08:52,166
Hey, hey, now. This was no one's
fault. It was an accident.

136
00:08:52,412 --> 00:08:54,767
It was my fault.
You should get the nice room.

137
00:08:55,012 --> 00:08:55,808
Okay!

138
00:08:57,652 --> 00:08:59,643
You're the first guest
at "Hotel Monica. "

139
00:08:59,852 --> 00:09:00,841
Hotel Monica!

140
00:09:01,092 --> 00:09:03,003
Just tell me how you like your eggs.

141
00:09:03,212 --> 00:09:05,487
I thought I'd bring them
to you in bed.

142
00:09:05,732 --> 00:09:08,007
-You've been through so much.
-I have.

143
00:09:09,652 --> 00:09:12,450
This right here is where
I keep the pizza.

144
00:09:13,812 --> 00:09:15,848
And that's where the napkin is.

145
00:09:16,732 --> 00:09:19,883
-What's that smell?
-I know! I don't. . .?

146
00:09:23,132 --> 00:09:27,444
Oh, please, it was such a big class.
You never even noticed me.

147
00:09:27,652 --> 00:09:31,770
What? Of course I did.
You sat next to "Sleepy Sleeperson. "

148
00:09:32,012 --> 00:09:32,967
Who?

149
00:09:33,212 --> 00:09:36,966
Oh. I had trouble remembering names,
so I came up with nicknames.

150
00:09:37,212 --> 00:09:41,046
The guy on the other side of you
was "Smelly Von Brown Shirt. "

151
00:09:41,532 --> 00:09:43,250
Oh, yeah.

152
00:09:44,532 --> 00:09:48,844
-So did you have a nickname for me?
-No. No.

153
00:09:49,092 --> 00:09:51,003
Yes, you did. What was it?

154
00:09:53,892 --> 00:09:55,211
"Cutie McPretty. "

155
00:09:55,412 --> 00:09:58,245
Oh, that's so sweet!

156
00:09:59,452 --> 00:10:02,444
Listen, I gotta tell you,
I'm having a great time.

157
00:10:02,652 --> 00:10:06,361
You said it might be weird,
the whole student/teacher thing?

158
00:10:06,612 --> 00:10:09,285
And to be frank,
I thought it would be too.

159
00:10:09,532 --> 00:10:11,727
But it's not.
I mean, it's not at all.

160
00:10:15,692 --> 00:10:17,444
-Dr. Geller!
-Burt!

161
00:10:20,852 --> 00:10:22,444
Did you sleep well last night?

162
00:10:22,692 --> 00:10:23,488
-I did.
-Yeah?

163
00:10:23,692 --> 00:10:27,048
Monica was so sweet.
She left a little mint on my pillow.

164
00:10:27,612 --> 00:10:29,409
Know what Joey left on my pillow?

165
00:10:29,612 --> 00:10:30,727
Gum.

166
00:10:31,532 --> 00:10:36,447
-We determined the cause of the fire.
-I know. It was my candle, my candle!

167
00:10:37,492 --> 00:10:41,280
No, there was an appliance left on.
It looks like a curling iron.

168
00:10:41,492 --> 00:10:43,847
-I don't use a curling iron.
-Someone does.

169
00:10:44,252 --> 00:10:47,801
Don't look at me, my hair's straight.
Straight, straight, straight.

170
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:51,451
-It could've been a hair-straightener.
-Oh.

171
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:55,648
This is where I keep the pizza.

172
00:10:56,452 --> 00:10:58,841
And--
Hey, where'd the napkin go?

173
00:11:06,012 --> 00:11:08,890
I wouldn't want my best guest
to strain her eyes.

174
00:11:09,132 --> 00:11:10,850
Thanks, Monica.

175
00:11:11,892 --> 00:11:14,167
-Does that smell bother you?
-From Joey's?

176
00:11:14,412 --> 00:11:16,289
I can hardly smell it over here.

177
00:11:17,132 --> 00:11:21,250
Well, you let me know if you can.
I can bake a pie to cover it.

178
00:11:22,412 --> 00:11:25,085
-I can smell it a little, bake the pie.
-Okay.

179
00:11:29,132 --> 00:11:30,247
Hello?

180
00:11:30,452 --> 00:11:33,205
One minute, please.
It's the fire inspector.

181
00:11:33,972 --> 00:11:36,850
Hello? Yeah, this is Phoebe.

182
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:38,368
Really?

183
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:42,247
Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn't
the hair-straightener. . .

184
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,124
. . .that started the fire.

185
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,642
No, no. It was the candles.

186
00:11:46,852 --> 00:11:50,083
Yeah. It's very not good
leaving candles unattended.

187
00:11:50,332 --> 00:11:54,769
In fact, one of the first things
they teach you in fire school is. . .

188
00:11:58,932 --> 00:12:01,002
. . .okay, well I have to go now.

189
00:12:05,932 --> 00:12:08,651
We had such a great time.
She's incredible.

190
00:12:08,892 --> 00:12:12,487
I thought the age difference might be
a problem, but it wasn't.

191
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,962
Elizabeth is very mature for her age.

192
00:12:19,452 --> 00:12:22,330
A concept lost on some people.

193
00:12:22,532 --> 00:12:24,090
It's okay to date a student?

194
00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:28,046
Well, not really. Technically,
it's not against the rules.

195
00:12:28,252 --> 00:12:32,086
But it's frowned upon, especially by
the professor we saw last night:

196
00:12:32,332 --> 00:12:34,163
"Judgy Von Holier-than-thou. "

197
00:12:37,092 --> 00:12:41,882
You don't want to get a reputation
as "Professor McNails-his-students. "

198
00:12:44,652 --> 00:12:47,962
-Yeah. What should I do?
-Well, it seems pretty clear.

199
00:12:48,212 --> 00:12:51,284
What's more important?
What people think or how you feel?

200
00:12:51,532 --> 00:12:54,842
-You gotta follow your heart.
-Joey, that's so sweet.

201
00:12:59,932 --> 00:13:02,207
-Hi.
-Hey! So how'd it go with Dana?

202
00:13:02,412 --> 00:13:05,961
Any reason I should leave a block
of time open? Say, Thursday?

203
00:13:06,332 --> 00:13:08,448
-I couldn't do it.
-You couldn't do it?

204
00:13:08,652 --> 00:13:11,007
I need more time.
We're going to dinner.

205
00:13:11,212 --> 00:13:13,009
You're going out with her again?

206
00:13:14,732 --> 00:13:17,690
-Going out with who?
-Dana Keystone, from college.

207
00:13:17,892 --> 00:13:20,452
Oh, yeah. Wasn't she. . .?

208
00:13:22,212 --> 00:13:23,565
No, that was Dana Kaplan.

209
00:13:23,772 --> 00:13:25,046
Oh.

210
00:13:26,692 --> 00:13:29,126
-Joey, you didn't even know her!
-Yeah, whatever.

211
00:13:33,732 --> 00:13:34,881
Great story again.

212
00:13:35,132 --> 00:13:38,841
The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo!

213
00:13:39,932 --> 00:13:42,685
You know, actually I should get going.

214
00:13:42,892 --> 00:13:46,726
Oh, no, no, stay!
Because you should stay.

215
00:13:48,292 --> 00:13:49,441
Wow.

216
00:13:49,732 --> 00:13:52,451
Oh, I am really flattered.

217
00:13:52,652 --> 00:13:56,884
But I just. . . .
I don't feel that way about you.

218
00:13:57,932 --> 00:13:59,445
Oh, no, no. That's not--

219
00:13:59,652 --> 00:14:03,122
I'm sorry, Chandler.
You know, you're such a sweet guy. . .

220
00:14:03,332 --> 00:14:05,402
. . .and I don't want to hurt you.

221
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:08,604
I wish I could do something
to make you feel better.

222
00:14:08,812 --> 00:14:10,848
No-- Really?

223
00:14:11,332 --> 00:14:12,606
Of course.

224
00:14:13,492 --> 00:14:15,642
Well, it just hurts so bad, l. . . .

225
00:14:16,372 --> 00:14:18,488
Oh, I'm sorry.

226
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:22,964
-Maybe there is one thing you can do.
-What? Anything. Anything.

227
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:26,843
Well, I mean, this is just
off the top of my head now.

228
00:14:28,212 --> 00:14:30,646
But I have this friend--
This actor friend.

229
00:14:30,892 --> 00:14:33,850
He would kill me if he knew
that I was doing this.

230
00:14:34,532 --> 00:14:35,647
But. . .

231
00:14:37,052 --> 00:14:41,967
. . .would it be possible for him to
audition for your movie on Thursday?

232
00:14:43,052 --> 00:14:44,451
Absolutely.

233
00:14:44,692 --> 00:14:45,841
But. . .

234
00:14:46,092 --> 00:14:50,802
. . .you'd really feel better if your
friend could audition for my movie?

235
00:14:51,052 --> 00:14:53,088
The heart wants what it wants. Bye.

236
00:15:00,052 --> 00:15:02,407
Hey! How's it going?

237
00:15:02,612 --> 00:15:05,524
Well, not much has changed
in the last five minutes.

238
00:15:06,012 --> 00:15:07,809
Yes, it has. I made cookies!

239
00:15:08,012 --> 00:15:10,845
I'm still full from your
homemade potato chips.

240
00:15:12,132 --> 00:15:15,966
But you should eat them now,
because they're hot from the oven.

241
00:15:16,452 --> 00:15:17,248
Okay.

242
00:15:17,452 --> 00:15:21,809
But not in here! Can't eat them
in bed, remember? No crummies!

243
00:15:22,012 --> 00:15:25,084
Oh. Okay, I'll be out in a second.

244
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:26,247
Okay.

245
00:15:34,612 --> 00:15:37,080
-What are you doing?
-This doesn't lock, does it?

246
00:15:42,932 --> 00:15:47,289
-Oh! Joey, I'm sorry.
-It's all right, don't worry about it.

247
00:15:47,492 --> 00:15:49,847
But look!
That's gonna leave a stain.

248
00:15:50,092 --> 00:15:53,448
Rach, hey, it's fine.
You're at Joey's.

249
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,642
-Really?
-Yeah, look.

250
00:16:00,852 --> 00:16:01,841
Yeah.

251
00:16:02,332 --> 00:16:05,051
-I've never lived like this before.
-I know.

252
00:16:08,892 --> 00:16:11,645
Well, don't waste it.
I mean, it's still food.

253
00:16:17,732 --> 00:16:20,246
What do you want to do now?
Want to get a drink?

254
00:16:20,492 --> 00:16:21,447
I can't.

255
00:16:21,652 --> 00:16:26,043
-Oh, you have some studying to do?
-No, I have some turning 21 to do.

256
00:16:27,732 --> 00:16:30,565
You know, I remember when I was
in college, we used to--

257
00:16:33,812 --> 00:16:38,044
-What are you doing?
-Nothing, I'm so comfortable with you.

258
00:16:41,612 --> 00:16:43,648
Do you not want to be seen with me?

259
00:16:43,852 --> 00:16:46,161
No, of course I do. Are they gone?

260
00:16:47,332 --> 00:16:50,290
No, they're still here.
But I think I'm about to leave.

261
00:16:50,532 --> 00:16:53,046
What? No, no, wait, wait--

262
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:56,888
You're right, this is stupid.
Who cares what people think?

263
00:16:57,132 --> 00:16:59,043
I mean, we like each other, right?

264
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:01,049
There's nothing wrong with that.

265
00:17:02,052 --> 00:17:03,041
Come on.

266
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:09,845
Burt. Lydia. Mel.

267
00:17:11,412 --> 00:17:13,289
-This is Elizabeth.
-Hi.

268
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,887
Aren't you in my popular culture
class?

269
00:17:16,132 --> 00:17:18,441
That's right, Lydia.
Elizabeth is a student.

270
00:17:18,652 --> 00:17:20,290
And we're dating.

271
00:17:20,532 --> 00:17:23,490
And you may frown upon that but. . .

272
00:17:23,732 --> 00:17:26,041
. . .we're not gonna hide it anymore.

273
00:17:27,812 --> 00:17:29,643
You are so fired.

274
00:17:31,532 --> 00:17:32,885
-What?
-They'll fire you.

275
00:17:33,132 --> 00:17:35,521
You can't date her.
It's against the rules.

276
00:17:35,772 --> 00:17:38,240
Really? It's not just frowned upon?

277
00:17:43,092 --> 00:17:45,401
I love it at Joey's!

278
00:17:49,092 --> 00:17:50,366
-Nice!
-Thanks.

279
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:51,886
So, you busy Thursday?

280
00:17:52,292 --> 00:17:56,843
Oh, very funny. Remember? My
audition was supposed to be Thursday.

281
00:18:00,332 --> 00:18:03,165
You got me the audition?
Let's hug it up!

282
00:18:03,372 --> 00:18:07,445
Okay, okay! What are you
gonna do to me if you get the part?

283
00:18:09,492 --> 00:18:10,641
-Hey.
-Hi.

284
00:18:10,852 --> 00:18:13,241
Yeah, okay, I need to talk to you.

285
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:16,689
I know they said the hair-straightener
started the fire.

286
00:18:16,932 --> 00:18:18,843
But I think I'm partly at fault.

287
00:18:19,052 --> 00:18:21,486
You see, I didn't tell you, but. . .

288
00:18:21,732 --> 00:18:24,246
. . .I had recently refilled
the tissues.

289
00:18:24,492 --> 00:18:27,086
And so, let's face it,
that's just kindling.

290
00:18:27,332 --> 00:18:30,210
So I think it's fair that
I stay at Joey's.

291
00:18:30,412 --> 00:18:33,051
No, no, no, this was my fault.

292
00:18:33,252 --> 00:18:35,641
-Besides, I'm fine here.
-Okay.

293
00:18:36,012 --> 00:18:38,651
-Chandler, Monica's looking for you.
-Really?

294
00:18:38,892 --> 00:18:43,044
-She said something about crummies.
-No, no, no! I was so careful.

295
00:18:44,732 --> 00:18:47,849
You have to switch with me.
Monica is driving me crazy.

296
00:18:48,052 --> 00:18:51,840
That's right. All the ladies
want to stay at Joey's.

297
00:18:53,452 --> 00:18:55,283
No, I don't want to switch.

298
00:18:55,532 --> 00:18:58,046
Please! I can throw
wet paper towels here!

299
00:18:58,252 --> 00:19:01,642
No, but at Monica's,
you can eat cookies over the sink.

300
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:05,681
I know. I'm sorry.

301
00:19:06,332 --> 00:19:07,845
All right, fine.

302
00:19:08,332 --> 00:19:12,848
This looks like so much fun.
God, what a mess.

303
00:19:18,652 --> 00:19:21,485
Wow, it actually is in the handbook.

304
00:19:21,732 --> 00:19:25,850
I can't date you or have
a hot plate in my office.

305
00:19:27,692 --> 00:19:31,048
I can't believe we have
to stop seeing each other.

306
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:35,682
For what it's worth, I did appreciate
you standing up for me.

307
00:19:36,132 --> 00:19:38,646
That felt really nice.

308
00:19:39,332 --> 00:19:41,323
Kind of made me like you even more.

309
00:19:41,532 --> 00:19:45,571
I know, I know. I really like
you too. But we can't date.

310
00:19:45,812 --> 00:19:48,087
It's against the rules.
It's forbidden.

311
00:19:49,092 --> 00:19:50,047
Wow.

312
00:19:50,532 --> 00:19:51,328
What?

313
00:19:51,532 --> 00:19:55,081
Just hearing you describe it
as "forbidden" . . .

314
00:19:55,292 --> 00:19:56,850
. . .it's really hot.

315
00:19:58,732 --> 00:20:00,051
Really?

316
00:20:00,932 --> 00:20:02,251
Yeah.

317
00:20:03,132 --> 00:20:07,444
Well, I don't care how hot it is,
it's wrong.

318
00:20:09,132 --> 00:20:12,647
-Stop it.
-No, no. It's wrong.

319
00:20:13,052 --> 00:20:14,451
It's naughty.

320
00:20:15,732 --> 00:20:16,847
It's. . .

321
00:20:17,692 --> 00:20:19,045
. . .taboo.

322
00:20:19,812 --> 00:20:20,608
Shut the book.

323
00:20:22,932 --> 00:20:26,049
Hey. Let's also get a hot plate.

324
00:20:30,732 --> 00:20:31,687
Hey.

325
00:20:32,052 --> 00:20:33,041
Hey.

326
00:20:33,252 --> 00:20:34,082
So?

327
00:20:34,532 --> 00:20:35,647
So. . .?

328
00:20:35,932 --> 00:20:38,082
It's Thursday! How was the audition?

329
00:20:38,292 --> 00:20:42,331
It's-- Monday, one day. Tuesday,
two day. Wednesday, what day--

330
00:20:44,732 --> 00:20:45,642
Oh!

00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
