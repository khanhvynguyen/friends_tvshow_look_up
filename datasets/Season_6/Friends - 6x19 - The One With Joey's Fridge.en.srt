1
00:00:06,132 --> 00:00:08,600
Well, that thing's clearly in the way.

2
00:00:10,212 --> 00:00:11,486
All right.

3
00:00:14,132 --> 00:00:15,531
Damn fridge!

4
00:00:16,932 --> 00:00:19,400
-Hi, Joey. How ya doin'?
-Great...

5
00:00:20,172 --> 00:00:21,207
...roomie.

6
00:00:22,092 --> 00:00:24,367
-Yeah, I guess we are roommates now.
-I know.

7
00:00:24,572 --> 00:00:27,803
Now that you bring it up,
our fridge is broken.

8
00:00:27,892 --> 00:00:29,291
We have to get a new one.

9
00:00:29,372 --> 00:00:32,967
I checked around and your half is $400.
Thanks a lot.

10
00:00:34,212 --> 00:00:36,168
I'm not paying for half of that.

11
00:00:36,292 --> 00:00:38,806
I'm only staying here
until my apartment gets fixed.

12
00:00:38,892 --> 00:00:43,408
Look, Rach, my parents bought this fridge
just after I was born. Okay?

13
00:00:43,652 --> 00:00:47,930
Now, I have never had a problem with it.
Then you show up and it breaks!

14
00:00:49,852 --> 00:00:51,410
What does that tell ya?

15
00:00:52,132 --> 00:00:55,488
That refrigerators don't live
as long as people?

16
00:00:57,732 --> 00:01:01,486
All right, you know that the ATM
only lets you take out $300 at a time, so...

17
00:01:01,612 --> 00:01:03,682
...l'll take a check for the other $100.

18
00:01:04,052 --> 00:01:05,485
You're jokin', right?

19
00:01:07,092 --> 00:01:09,890
Of course I'm joking. I don't take checks.

20
00:01:12,052 --> 00:01:13,804
Thank God, you're pretty.

21
00:01:17,132 --> 00:01:19,123
The One with Joey's Fridge

22
00:01:20,292 --> 00:01:21,281
English subtitles by Softitler

23
00:01:55,892 --> 00:01:58,725
Hi! Do you guys know any cute guys?

24
00:01:58,812 --> 00:02:01,690
Well, of course, I do.
My good friend, Joey, over here.

25
00:02:05,732 --> 00:02:08,292
I'm sorry. Thank you, Chandler.

26
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:13,721
There's a big charity ball this weekend
and Ralph Lauren bought a table...

27
00:02:13,812 --> 00:02:15,006
...so I kind of have to go.

28
00:02:15,092 --> 00:02:17,208
-What's the charity?
-I don't know.

29
00:02:17,292 --> 00:02:20,728
Something, either trees or disease....

30
00:02:21,372 --> 00:02:22,930
Ralph mumbles a lot.

31
00:02:23,772 --> 00:02:27,685
-He mumbles when you're not attentive?
-Yeah. It's weird.

32
00:02:28,692 --> 00:02:30,887
But the thing is, I need to find a date.

33
00:02:31,052 --> 00:02:32,531
What type are you looking for?

34
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:36,406
Someone that has his own tux
or the ability to rent a tux.

35
00:02:36,492 --> 00:02:39,325
So he has to be a male
who has at least $50.

36
00:02:40,172 --> 00:02:41,366
So close.

37
00:02:42,932 --> 00:02:44,650
-Hi, everybody!
-Hi, there.

38
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:47,366
-This is Elizabeth.
-Hi, Elizabeth.

39
00:02:47,732 --> 00:02:49,324
I'm a student.

40
00:02:49,932 --> 00:02:52,048
Isn't she cute? Nope.

41
00:02:53,892 --> 00:02:56,884
This is none of my business,
but weren't you guys supposed to...

42
00:02:56,972 --> 00:02:59,088
...not be seen in public together?

43
00:02:59,172 --> 00:03:00,287
We're not together.

44
00:03:00,372 --> 00:03:04,365
No. We're just two people who happen
to have run into each other here.

45
00:03:04,452 --> 00:03:05,646
This is....

46
00:03:07,332 --> 00:03:08,401
Oh, sly!

47
00:03:10,292 --> 00:03:12,931
I really wanted to meet you guys,
but I have to run.

48
00:03:13,012 --> 00:03:14,650
-I'll see ya later?
-Okay.

49
00:03:14,732 --> 00:03:16,484
-Bye, Ross.
-Bye. See you.

50
00:03:16,932 --> 00:03:20,686
-Didn't mean to run into you like that, sir.
-That is quite all right, ma'am.

51
00:03:20,812 --> 00:03:21,722
Bye.

52
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:26,286
So, why's she leaving? ls it a school night
and she has a lot of homework?

53
00:03:26,812 --> 00:03:29,804
Yes. Her molecular epidemiology paper
is due tomorrow.

54
00:03:31,332 --> 00:03:33,448
Well, tell her "good luck" with that.

55
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,242
Anyone else? Bring 'em on.

56
00:03:37,012 --> 00:03:40,049
-When's her birthday?
-I don't know, Rachel. Why?

57
00:03:40,132 --> 00:03:44,171
Well, you know it's just been so long
since I've been to Chuck E. Cheese.

58
00:03:45,852 --> 00:03:47,968
-I like Elizabeth.
-Well, thanks.

59
00:03:48,052 --> 00:03:52,409
In fact, I like her so much that you tell her
I want my cookies early this year.

60
00:03:52,812 --> 00:03:55,042
A box of Thin Mints and some Tagalongs.

61
00:03:56,652 --> 00:03:59,803
Guys, give him a break.
Ross, seriously, how's it going with her?

62
00:03:59,892 --> 00:04:01,245
Well, it's actually been great.

63
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:06,282
She's 20, so she's not looking for anything
too serious, which is perfect for me now.

64
00:04:06,452 --> 00:04:09,330
Well, that is great.
And seriously, she seems very nice.

65
00:04:09,412 --> 00:04:11,562
I know you guys like
giving me a hard time...

66
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:14,086
...but it means a lot to me
that you like her.

67
00:04:14,172 --> 00:04:16,925
-Just knowing you guys are, like--
-Okay, I got a good one.

68
00:04:19,612 --> 00:04:21,603
What is she, like 12?

69
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:34,444
Chandler, do you think we talk
about our relationship enough?

70
00:04:34,532 --> 00:04:36,762
Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll Ups?

71
00:04:39,532 --> 00:04:40,408
Okay.

72
00:04:40,492 --> 00:04:43,245
I just thought of the perfect guy
for Rachel to take.

73
00:04:43,332 --> 00:04:45,368
That's so funny
'cause we found someone, too.

74
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:49,445
That's good. I guess she'll have a choice
between my guy and your weirdo.

75
00:04:50,212 --> 00:04:53,522
-Why would our guy be a weirdo?
-'Cause that's just your taste.

76
00:04:54,772 --> 00:04:57,730
See, Rachel's not gonna pick
your stupid guy.

77
00:04:57,852 --> 00:04:58,921
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

78
00:04:59,012 --> 00:05:02,004
My guy is a lawyer
who does volunteer work.

79
00:05:02,132 --> 00:05:04,407
And, he has one of these.

80
00:05:06,052 --> 00:05:07,121
A face ass?

81
00:05:08,292 --> 00:05:09,486
A chin dimple.

82
00:05:09,932 --> 00:05:11,923
Well, our guy works with Chandler.

83
00:05:12,052 --> 00:05:15,203
And he's really nice and smart
and he's a great dresser.

84
00:05:15,292 --> 00:05:19,285
-Have you seen your guy's body?
-No. Our guy's just a floating head.

85
00:05:20,732 --> 00:05:24,008
Well, my guy is spectacular, okay?
He's a massage client.

86
00:05:24,092 --> 00:05:28,688
And one time, when he was on the table,
I looked at it. And I mean, all of it.

87
00:05:30,052 --> 00:05:33,442
-You're not supposed to look.
-Yeah, like there are police for that.

88
00:05:34,372 --> 00:05:36,328
What, you look? You massaged me.

89
00:05:36,412 --> 00:05:37,447
I know.

90
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:42,684
All right, your guy may have a great body,
but our guy...

91
00:05:42,772 --> 00:05:44,000
...is really funny.

92
00:05:44,132 --> 00:05:45,167
Chandler funny?

93
00:05:46,772 --> 00:05:49,002
-Our guy's a great dancer.
-My guy's well-read.

94
00:05:49,092 --> 00:05:51,447
-Our guy has great hair.
-My guy has great teeth.

95
00:05:51,532 --> 00:05:53,807
Our guys smells incredible.

96
00:05:55,092 --> 00:05:57,208
Do you want our guy to be your guy?

97
00:06:06,212 --> 00:06:08,851
Well, you don't look good, Joe.

98
00:06:10,092 --> 00:06:13,084
Well, the fridge broke,
so I had to eat everything.

99
00:06:14,172 --> 00:06:16,367
Cold cuts, ice cream, limes.

100
00:06:17,732 --> 00:06:19,165
What was in that brown jar?

101
00:06:19,252 --> 00:06:21,641
-That's still in there?
-Not anymore.

102
00:06:22,892 --> 00:06:25,690
So, anyway, how do you want to pay me?

103
00:06:27,572 --> 00:06:29,961
Is this a service you're providing me?

104
00:06:31,052 --> 00:06:34,761
No, for my new fridge. For our new fridge.

105
00:06:35,052 --> 00:06:36,405
"Our" new fridge?

106
00:06:36,572 --> 00:06:38,767
-I don't live here anymore.
-So what?

107
00:06:39,092 --> 00:06:42,289
Look, okay, suppose we were
a divorced couple.

108
00:06:42,812 --> 00:06:45,246
And I got custody of the kid. Right?

109
00:06:45,332 --> 00:06:49,245
Now suppose the kid dies
and I gotta buy a new kid.

110
00:06:52,372 --> 00:06:53,487
Okay.

111
00:06:54,932 --> 00:06:56,843
Gimme $400!

112
00:07:02,932 --> 00:07:04,331
Professor Geller?

113
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:06,803
Oh, a student I don't know.

114
00:07:09,292 --> 00:07:11,806
I was wondering
if I could talk to you for a moment?

115
00:07:11,892 --> 00:07:14,360
Yes, of course.
What would this be regarding?

116
00:07:14,452 --> 00:07:16,124
Making out in your office.

117
00:07:18,052 --> 00:07:20,805
Of course. Why don't we go inside.

118
00:07:29,252 --> 00:07:31,243
-What?
-Doorknob.

119
00:07:31,332 --> 00:07:32,321
Sorry.

120
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:35,568
I actually do need to talk to you.

121
00:07:35,652 --> 00:07:36,767
Okay, what about?

122
00:07:36,852 --> 00:07:39,241
-Spring vacation?
-Spring vacation?

123
00:07:39,572 --> 00:07:42,803
Yeah, we have time off
and a lot of people are going on trips--

124
00:07:42,892 --> 00:07:46,771
-Professor Geller.
-Yes, Professor Fiesenstinlender?

125
00:07:47,692 --> 00:07:49,364
I'll be with you in one moment.

126
00:07:50,932 --> 00:07:53,765
So, I will take one box of the Thin Mints.

127
00:07:58,012 --> 00:08:02,767
You don't understand. Elizabeth was
about to ask me to go on a trip with her.

128
00:08:02,892 --> 00:08:05,531
Is that taking it slow?
I'm not ready for this, okay?

129
00:08:05,612 --> 00:08:08,763
-What do I tell her?
-Tell her the truth. You're not ready.

130
00:08:10,092 --> 00:08:11,491
I could do that.

131
00:08:12,652 --> 00:08:16,088
-Well, what if she gets upset?
-Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.

132
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:21,446
Or, you could just, you know, you....

133
00:08:27,252 --> 00:08:29,049
What the hell are you doing?

134
00:08:30,772 --> 00:08:33,684
What the hell am I doin'?
You just broke my fridge!

135
00:08:36,012 --> 00:08:37,684
What? How do you know it....

136
00:08:37,772 --> 00:08:39,603
How do you know it's even broken?

137
00:08:39,692 --> 00:08:42,206
You think I don't know
what breaks my fridge?

138
00:08:43,292 --> 00:08:44,441
Excuse me!

139
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:47,291
Well, what do you know?

140
00:08:47,732 --> 00:08:48,767
Broken!

141
00:08:49,852 --> 00:08:51,649
That'll be $400.

142
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:54,641
Joey, I saw you push him.

143
00:08:57,132 --> 00:08:58,451
You pushed him?

144
00:09:00,852 --> 00:09:05,164
Joey, I did not break this. Okay?
That has been broken for a while.

145
00:09:08,052 --> 00:09:10,327
Chandler, remember I told you
about our fridge?

146
00:09:10,692 --> 00:09:13,604
I still haven't gotten the check
for your half yet.

147
00:09:14,612 --> 00:09:16,170
Do not give him any money!

148
00:09:16,292 --> 00:09:18,886
I'm not talkin' to you!
You broke my fridge!

149
00:09:27,332 --> 00:09:30,768
-You wanted to see me, Professor Geller?
-Yes. Please come in.

150
00:09:36,212 --> 00:09:39,090
-Doorknob?
-Yeah. It kind of grows on you.

151
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:43,523
Actually, I wanted to finish
talking to you about spring vacation.

152
00:09:43,612 --> 00:09:44,727
Good.

153
00:09:47,012 --> 00:09:48,127
Look, l....

154
00:09:52,932 --> 00:09:55,127
I've been having a great time with you.

155
00:09:55,212 --> 00:10:00,161
And I just don't want us to move too fast
or put too much pressure on us.

156
00:10:01,092 --> 00:10:04,164
So, I'm sorry, I just don't think
we should go away together yet.

157
00:10:04,252 --> 00:10:05,571
It's too soon.

158
00:10:06,092 --> 00:10:09,050
Ross, I think you misunderstood
what I was saying.

159
00:10:09,612 --> 00:10:13,571
I just wanted to tell you that
I'm going to Florida for a couple weeks.

160
00:10:17,652 --> 00:10:18,641
No.

161
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:23,401
I think you misunderstood
what I was saying.

162
00:10:24,252 --> 00:10:25,367
What I meant was--

163
00:10:25,452 --> 00:10:26,726
You are so adorable.

164
00:10:27,092 --> 00:10:29,925
That. Let's talk about that.

165
00:10:33,292 --> 00:10:34,486
-Hi.
-Hi.

166
00:10:34,572 --> 00:10:36,324
How did it go with Elizabeth?

167
00:10:36,692 --> 00:10:40,765
Fine. It was just a misunderstanding.
She didn't want me to go with her.

168
00:10:40,892 --> 00:10:44,487
She just wanted to tell me that
she's going to Florida for spring vacation.

169
00:10:44,572 --> 00:10:47,723
Wait, is she going for spring vacation
or spring break, wahoo?

170
00:10:50,372 --> 00:10:51,600
What's the difference?

171
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:54,843
A spring vacation, you're doing nice things
with your grandparents.

172
00:10:54,972 --> 00:10:57,532
Spring break, you're doing frat guys.

173
00:10:59,212 --> 00:11:02,204
You know what?
Not all spring breaks are like that.

174
00:11:02,332 --> 00:11:05,210
-What did you do on yours?
-I went to Egypt with my dad.

175
00:11:07,132 --> 00:11:10,249
I can see it now.
"Look, Dad, it's the Sphinx, wahoo! "

176
00:11:12,252 --> 00:11:15,608
I think Elizabeth is a little more serious
than: "Spring break, wahoo! "

177
00:11:17,412 --> 00:11:19,562
All right? Come on, she's taking my class.

178
00:11:19,652 --> 00:11:22,564
-And slept with the professor.
-I'm gonna call her.

179
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:29,210
You guys, I want you to meet Sebastian.

180
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:34,004
We just met at the newsstand. We both
grabbed for the last Field and Stream.

181
00:11:36,052 --> 00:11:37,804
What? I read that.

182
00:11:38,812 --> 00:11:41,690
-Can I get you a cup of coffee?
-Yes. Thank you.

183
00:11:44,812 --> 00:11:48,009
-Rachel, what the hell is this?
-What?

184
00:11:48,092 --> 00:11:51,880
You ask us to find you a guy and then
you come in here with a guy of your own.

185
00:11:51,972 --> 00:11:53,087
You found me a guy?

186
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:56,801
Yes, we found you a really cute
and funny guy from Chandler's work.

187
00:11:56,892 --> 00:12:00,168
Yeah, and I found you one, too,
who is not a weirdo.

188
00:12:01,612 --> 00:12:04,285
You know what though, guys,
I really appreciate that...

189
00:12:04,372 --> 00:12:06,932
...but I'm just gonna take Sebastian
to the charity.

190
00:12:07,012 --> 00:12:09,924
Are you sure?
Because our guy smells incredible.

191
00:12:10,012 --> 00:12:12,287
Would you stop it with that already?

192
00:12:12,812 --> 00:12:15,372
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

193
00:12:16,332 --> 00:12:19,449
So, Sebastian,
do you do any volunteer work?

194
00:12:19,852 --> 00:12:21,843
-No, not really. Why?
-No reason.

195
00:12:21,932 --> 00:12:25,368
It's just I know a single guy
who does care about other people.

196
00:12:26,332 --> 00:12:27,685
Are you funny?

197
00:12:29,012 --> 00:12:31,367
-Excuse me?
-What are you guys doing?

198
00:12:31,452 --> 00:12:33,761
Are you funny? Tell us a joke!

199
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:37,442
Look, I just wanted
to have coffee with Rachel.

200
00:12:37,532 --> 00:12:39,568
Well, so do a lot of people.

201
00:12:41,132 --> 00:12:43,600
-Actually, I gotta get going.
-But you--

202
00:12:44,132 --> 00:12:47,090
-Give me a call sometime.
-But you didn't give me your number.

203
00:12:47,172 --> 00:12:48,810
Okay, see you later.

204
00:12:50,252 --> 00:12:52,129
Turns out he is kinda funny.

205
00:12:56,492 --> 00:12:58,483
I cannot believe you guys!

206
00:12:58,572 --> 00:13:01,803
He was really nice
and he just left because of you!

207
00:13:01,972 --> 00:13:05,009
Yeah, but, "Sebastian"?
What is that, a cat's name?

208
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:08,686
You know what I noticed, Rachel,
he scares easy.

209
00:13:09,412 --> 00:13:11,926
Now, is that the kind of guy
you want to take to a ball?

210
00:13:12,012 --> 00:13:13,968
"Sebastian, would you like to dance?"

211
00:13:14,412 --> 00:13:15,891
"Okay. I gotta go."

212
00:13:17,092 --> 00:13:19,652
All right, guys stop it.
Rachel, we're very sorry.

213
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:22,292
That is a very insensitive thing
for us to do.

214
00:13:22,532 --> 00:13:26,161
You know what? Let's make it up to you.
We've two great guys for you.

215
00:13:26,252 --> 00:13:27,924
Yeah, what have you got to lose?

216
00:13:28,012 --> 00:13:32,085
You might even end up with someone
really special. If you pick my guy.

217
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:35,806
-All right.
-Okay. So, you will meet our guys?

218
00:13:35,892 --> 00:13:37,007
Yes, I'll meet 'em.

219
00:13:37,092 --> 00:13:39,925
It doesn't matter which one you choose.
It's up to you.

220
00:13:40,012 --> 00:13:41,968
Our guy is perfect.

221
00:13:42,372 --> 00:13:46,650
Or you could go out with the guy
Phoebe deemed was unsuitable for herself.

222
00:13:47,492 --> 00:13:49,881
Phoebe, there you are!
Okay, you broke my fridge.

223
00:13:49,972 --> 00:13:51,564
You owe me $400.

224
00:13:53,012 --> 00:13:54,889
-Okay, sure.
-Really?

225
00:13:56,332 --> 00:14:00,120
Technically, you owe me $600
for sending out happy thoughts...

226
00:14:00,212 --> 00:14:02,203
...on your last 10 auditions.

227
00:14:06,652 --> 00:14:07,721
Call it even?

228
00:14:09,652 --> 00:14:10,607
Okay.

229
00:14:13,292 --> 00:14:14,361
There you are.

230
00:14:14,452 --> 00:14:16,170
So, what did Elizabeth say?

231
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:19,364
Turns out she is going to Daytona
for "spring break, wahoo! "

232
00:14:20,372 --> 00:14:24,445
That means wet T-shirt contests,
guys doing shots off of girls' bodies...

233
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,722
...waking up next to people
you don't even know.

234
00:14:26,812 --> 00:14:29,087
She is gonna have a great time!

235
00:14:30,892 --> 00:14:33,087
Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?

236
00:14:33,652 --> 00:14:37,201
-You know the hotels?
-I was there! Spring Break '81, wahoo!

237
00:14:38,492 --> 00:14:40,323
In 1981, you were 13.

238
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:43,643
So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts.
I had a blast.

239
00:14:43,812 --> 00:14:47,521
You know who knows how to party?
Drunk college chicks.

240
00:14:49,572 --> 00:14:51,563
Okay, she can't go.

241
00:14:52,052 --> 00:14:54,691
You can't tell her not to go.
You just started dating.

242
00:14:54,772 --> 00:14:57,764
-Then what am I supposed to do?
-Nothing. Just be cool with it.

243
00:14:57,852 --> 00:15:00,924
What if she goes down there
and then sleeps with a bunch of guys?

244
00:15:01,012 --> 00:15:03,401
Well, maybe you don't marry this one.

245
00:15:11,092 --> 00:15:13,048
I'm so glad you're going on this trip.

246
00:15:13,132 --> 00:15:16,488
Yeah, I've been working
so hard this semester.

247
00:15:16,652 --> 00:15:19,086
I really need to go crazy,
blow off some steam.

248
00:15:19,172 --> 00:15:20,287
Sure.

249
00:15:22,412 --> 00:15:26,246
Look, I don't know if your plans
are finalized yet, but...

250
00:15:26,812 --> 00:15:29,565
...l know another great way
to blow off steam.

251
00:15:29,692 --> 00:15:32,490
-What?
-Are you into crafts at all?

252
00:15:34,332 --> 00:15:35,845
Ross, are you okay?

253
00:15:35,932 --> 00:15:37,809
Yeah. Of course I'm okay.

254
00:15:37,892 --> 00:15:39,928
I'm just being supportive.

255
00:15:40,012 --> 00:15:42,890
Supportive of you and this whole trip...

256
00:15:42,972 --> 00:15:45,770
...and what's this?

257
00:15:47,772 --> 00:15:49,330
It's a bathing suit?

258
00:15:49,412 --> 00:15:51,289
To wear in front of people?

259
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:53,846
Is that supportive?

260
00:15:53,972 --> 00:15:55,041
Is this?

261
00:15:58,052 --> 00:15:59,201
Okay, good.

262
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,361
-Hi.
-Hi.

263
00:16:00,452 --> 00:16:04,365
We're so glad you decided to meet our guy.
You're gonna like him so much.

264
00:16:04,612 --> 00:16:07,285
-When do you want to meet him?
-I don't know.

265
00:16:07,372 --> 00:16:10,250
-I don't work late tomorrow night.
-Tomorrow night is good.

266
00:16:10,372 --> 00:16:14,251
But why put off something 'til tomorrow
when you can do it right now.

267
00:16:14,332 --> 00:16:16,607
-Eldad, come here!
-What?

268
00:16:17,772 --> 00:16:19,922
-Eldad, this is Rachel.
-How are you?

269
00:16:20,132 --> 00:16:22,646
A little blind-sided, but, you know, good.

270
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:26,292
Eldad, sit down. Move over now.

271
00:16:27,132 --> 00:16:28,804
There you go. There you are.

272
00:16:30,132 --> 00:16:31,929
Okay, we can take a hint!

273
00:16:33,612 --> 00:16:35,807
What? What are you doing here?

274
00:16:35,892 --> 00:16:37,166
This is Patrick.

275
00:16:37,252 --> 00:16:38,241
-Hi.
-Hi.

276
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,932
You're too late,
because she's already with our guy.

277
00:16:41,012 --> 00:16:45,244
Oh, my God, you're right, I am too late.
They're sitting on the couch and talking.

278
00:16:45,892 --> 00:16:46,927
Come on.

279
00:16:48,692 --> 00:16:50,569
Rachel? This is Patrick.

280
00:16:51,612 --> 00:16:52,601
-Hi.
-Hi.

281
00:16:52,732 --> 00:16:54,882
This is the guy I was telling you about.

282
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:58,487
Believe me, this suit does not do justice
to what's underneath it.

283
00:16:59,612 --> 00:17:00,727
Okay.

284
00:17:01,052 --> 00:17:05,045
But Pheebs, I'm just sort of
in the middle of something.

285
00:17:05,532 --> 00:17:07,488
Okay. Have a seat.

286
00:17:08,572 --> 00:17:10,528
-You can't do that!
-Maybe I should go.

287
00:17:10,652 --> 00:17:12,643
Just sit down, we're winning.

288
00:17:13,852 --> 00:17:16,082
Okay, you know what? Maybe I should go.

289
00:17:16,212 --> 00:17:17,440
No. Have a seat!

290
00:17:17,532 --> 00:17:20,126
Rachel, you haven't touched Eldad's hair.

291
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:23,325
-It is the softest hair. Touch it.
-I'm good.

292
00:17:23,412 --> 00:17:26,927
Rachel, Patrick is really rich.
Give her some money.

293
00:17:29,452 --> 00:17:31,841
Phoebe, this isn't really worth
the free massage.

294
00:17:31,932 --> 00:17:33,968
-That's right, Patrick. Bye-bye.
-No.

295
00:17:34,132 --> 00:17:37,169
Eldad is much more cooperative
and he can dance.

296
00:17:37,252 --> 00:17:38,810
You dance for Rachel.

297
00:17:39,332 --> 00:17:41,129
No, don't dance for me, please!

298
00:17:41,612 --> 00:17:43,682
What is the matter with you guys?

299
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:45,808
Yeah, okay, let's talk it out.

300
00:17:46,692 --> 00:17:49,331
Am I the only one
that this is embarrassing for?

301
00:17:49,412 --> 00:17:51,209
I'm a little embarrassed.

302
00:17:53,252 --> 00:17:57,325
I'll tell you who should be embarrassed.
It's you guys. This is ridiculous!

303
00:17:57,452 --> 00:17:59,886
Thank you, but I do not need you
to get me a date.

304
00:17:59,972 --> 00:18:02,725
-Then why did she ask us to help her--
-I am still talking!

305
00:18:02,812 --> 00:18:05,610
Then you chase away
the one guy that I actually liked.

306
00:18:05,692 --> 00:18:09,162
No offense to you guys.
Really, congratulations on...

307
00:18:09,372 --> 00:18:10,805
...all the cash.

308
00:18:11,532 --> 00:18:14,569
And you really do have very soft hair.

309
00:18:14,652 --> 00:18:19,646
But I'd much rather go to the ball
by myself than go through more of this.

310
00:18:19,772 --> 00:18:20,761
Goodbye.

311
00:18:23,212 --> 00:18:26,727
Now, do you use some sort
of special conditioner on that hair?

312
00:18:26,852 --> 00:18:28,046
Yes, papaya extract.

313
00:18:28,172 --> 00:18:29,321
Thank you.

314
00:18:34,492 --> 00:18:37,245
So, have a great time down there.

315
00:18:37,372 --> 00:18:38,691
-I will.
-Yeah.

316
00:18:38,772 --> 00:18:41,206
-Did you pack that bathing suit?
-Yeah.

317
00:18:41,372 --> 00:18:44,125
It was pretty funny
when I hid it for a while.

318
00:18:47,612 --> 00:18:48,601
Anyway.

319
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,362
I am worried about that bathing suit.

320
00:18:52,452 --> 00:18:55,444
Not because it's revealing,
which I'm fine with.

321
00:18:55,532 --> 00:18:57,682
No, I'm concerned about your health.

322
00:18:59,052 --> 00:19:00,405
Sun exposure.

323
00:19:00,492 --> 00:19:02,801
Don't worry, I have plenty of sun block.

324
00:19:02,932 --> 00:19:04,650
-It's SPF 30.
-All right.

325
00:19:04,772 --> 00:19:07,764
Well, if what's in the bottle is actually 30.

326
00:19:07,892 --> 00:19:11,202
I mean, sometimes you get 30,
sometimes it's 4 and I swear...

327
00:19:11,292 --> 00:19:13,442
...more often than not, it's just milk.

328
00:19:14,572 --> 00:19:16,881
Ross, it's gonna be okay.

329
00:19:17,332 --> 00:19:20,085
I'm not going down there
to hook up with a bunch of guys.

330
00:19:20,532 --> 00:19:21,965
I really like you.

331
00:19:22,052 --> 00:19:24,247
I like how things are going between us.

332
00:19:24,412 --> 00:19:25,640
-Really?
-Yeah.

333
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:29,008
I'm just going down there to relax
and hang out with my friends.

334
00:19:29,652 --> 00:19:31,483
Okay. Cool.

335
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,440
Here they are!

336
00:19:45,612 --> 00:19:46,840
Call me!

337
00:19:52,212 --> 00:19:54,567
Rachel, we're sorry
for pushing those guys on you.

338
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:57,485
That's all right.
I ended up having a really good time.

339
00:19:57,572 --> 00:20:01,690
The charity was a big success,
they raised a lot of money and awareness.

340
00:20:01,772 --> 00:20:03,410
So, what was it for, anyway?

341
00:20:05,252 --> 00:20:07,288
I wanna say a disease.

342
00:20:10,692 --> 00:20:14,731
I just got this weird message from Ross.
He said to turn on MTV. I don't know.

343
00:20:19,692 --> 00:20:22,001
Oh, my God, look! That's Elizabeth!

344
00:20:31,932 --> 00:20:33,650
Professor Geller.

345
00:20:36,132 --> 00:20:38,487
To be 13 again....
