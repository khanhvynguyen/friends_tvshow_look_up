1
00:00:04,972 --> 00:00:07,167
"We've got three minutes
till the reactor blows.

2
00:00:07,252 --> 00:00:08,446
"We'll never make it! "

3
00:00:08,532 --> 00:00:11,490
"You've got to get out of here!
Save yourself! "

4
00:00:13,212 --> 00:00:14,611
"No, I won't leave you."

5
00:00:14,692 --> 00:00:18,970
"Don't worry about me.
I'm a robot. I'm just a machine! "

6
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:24,088
-"No, you're not. Not to me."
-Oh, my God.

7
00:00:24,612 --> 00:00:27,172
-What?
-I am extremely talented.

8
00:00:28,252 --> 00:00:29,810
-Yeah. You're great.
-Yeah.

9
00:00:29,892 --> 00:00:33,726
-Okay, let's take it from--
-No, I mean, I was really acting my ass off.

10
00:00:34,772 --> 00:00:36,524
I thought I was pretty good, too.

11
00:00:36,612 --> 00:00:39,285
Yeah, you're solid. You're just no me.

12
00:00:40,972 --> 00:00:43,042
You know what?
I think that's enough for now.

13
00:00:43,132 --> 00:00:45,202
I don't want to be over-rehearsed.

14
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:48,565
Fine. I'll do it without you!

15
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:51,521
I don't need you or anybody else!

16
00:00:51,772 --> 00:00:53,922
I'm gonna make it on my own!

17
00:00:55,532 --> 00:00:58,205
You'll see! You'll all see!

18
00:01:00,292 --> 00:01:03,284
The One With Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.

19
00:01:03,452 --> 00:01:04,441
English subtitles by Softitler

20
00:01:37,692 --> 00:01:39,887
So, what's this thing
you're auditioning for?

21
00:01:39,972 --> 00:01:41,690
It's a new TV show. Yeah.

22
00:01:41,772 --> 00:01:45,003
I'm up for the part of Mac,
Machiavelli, or "Mac"!

23
00:01:46,932 --> 00:01:51,005
I'm a detective and I solve crimes
with the help of my robot partner.

24
00:01:51,172 --> 00:01:53,686
He's a computerized humanoid...

25
00:01:53,772 --> 00:01:56,809
...electronically enhanced, secret enforcer.

26
00:01:56,932 --> 00:01:58,729
Or, "C.H.E.E.S.E."

27
00:02:00,652 --> 00:02:04,725
-So, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.?
-That's the title!

28
00:02:06,492 --> 00:02:09,484
They really lucked out
that the initials spell "cheese."

29
00:02:09,932 --> 00:02:11,411
That is lucky.

30
00:02:12,812 --> 00:02:15,201
So Joey, if you get this,
you're gonna be, like...

31
00:02:15,292 --> 00:02:17,010
...the star of your own TV show.

32
00:02:17,092 --> 00:02:21,404
I mean, you'll be like the "Big Cheese"
or the "Big Mac." Hey, you love those!

33
00:02:22,012 --> 00:02:25,049
Don't get your hopes up,
because it's probably not gonna happen.

34
00:02:25,132 --> 00:02:26,850
Now, why would you say that, Joseph?

35
00:02:26,932 --> 00:02:29,969
Well, I mean, come on you guys.
My own TV show?

36
00:02:30,052 --> 00:02:32,725
-I don't know if I'm good enough.
-I am.

37
00:02:34,492 --> 00:02:37,404
What are you talkin' about?
You're a terrific actor.

38
00:02:37,732 --> 00:02:40,929
-You really think so?
-How can you even ask that question?

39
00:02:42,452 --> 00:02:45,728
-She's pretty.
-Yeah. And she's really nice, too.

40
00:02:45,812 --> 00:02:48,884
She taught me all about, you know,
how to work with cameras...

41
00:02:48,972 --> 00:02:50,928
...and "smell the fart" acting.

42
00:02:53,732 --> 00:02:56,200
-I'm sorry. What, Joey?
-What? Excuse me?

43
00:02:56,292 --> 00:02:59,364
It's like you got so many lines
to learn so fast...

44
00:02:59,452 --> 00:03:02,603
...that sometimes you need a minute
to remember your next one.

45
00:03:02,692 --> 00:03:07,447
So while you're thinkin' of it, you take
this big pause where you look all intense.

46
00:03:07,532 --> 00:03:09,011
You know, like this.

47
00:03:11,332 --> 00:03:12,367
Okay.

48
00:03:13,932 --> 00:03:16,002
Here's my scene! Here's my scene!

49
00:03:16,692 --> 00:03:17,886
Mrs. Wallace?

50
00:03:17,972 --> 00:03:20,566
I'm Dr. Drake Ramorey,
your sister's neurosurgeon.

51
00:03:20,652 --> 00:03:22,722
You sister is suffering from a....

52
00:03:27,692 --> 00:03:32,641
Well, Eva, we've done
some excellent work here.

53
00:03:34,132 --> 00:03:39,081
And I would have to say
your problem is quite clear.

54
00:03:41,572 --> 00:03:44,484
"All you want is a tinkle

55
00:03:45,252 --> 00:03:47,447
"What you envy's a schwang

56
00:03:48,052 --> 00:03:50,964
"A thing through which you can tinkle

57
00:03:51,372 --> 00:03:54,011
"Or play with or simply let hang"

58
00:03:54,092 --> 00:03:56,367
I play AI Pacino's butt.

59
00:03:58,332 --> 00:03:59,401
All right?

60
00:03:59,492 --> 00:04:02,723
He goes into the shower and then,
I'm his butt.

61
00:04:03,652 --> 00:04:06,007
-Oh, my God.
-Come on, you guys.

62
00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:09,164
This is a real movie and AI Pacino's in it,
and that's big!

63
00:04:09,252 --> 00:04:13,245
No, it's terrific. You deserve this
after all your years of struggling...

64
00:04:13,412 --> 00:04:16,768
...you've finally been able
to crack your way into show business.

65
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:23,565
Okay, fine, make jokes. I don't care.
This is a big break for me.

66
00:04:23,652 --> 00:04:25,802
-No, you're right, it is.
-Yeah.

67
00:04:26,212 --> 00:04:28,851
So, you gonna invite us all
to the big opening?

68
00:04:30,932 --> 00:04:33,048
All right, I'm out of here. Wish me luck.

69
00:04:33,132 --> 00:04:36,329
"Good luck, good luck
We all wish you good luck"

70
00:04:40,412 --> 00:04:41,925
Yeah, whatever.

71
00:04:47,172 --> 00:04:48,525
It's your turn.

72
00:04:49,532 --> 00:04:51,204
Oh, are we playing this?

73
00:04:53,572 --> 00:04:55,130
Hi. How did the audition go?

74
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:59,330
Terrible. I messed up every word.
I shouldn't even be an actor.

75
00:04:59,572 --> 00:05:02,928
Wait. Are you doin' that thing
where you pretend it didn't go well...

76
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:04,889
...but it really did go well?

77
00:05:05,492 --> 00:05:08,689
-Yeah, did I fool ya?
-Totally!

78
00:05:10,052 --> 00:05:12,566
-So, it did go well?
-It went amazingly well!

79
00:05:12,652 --> 00:05:13,846
-Great!
-That's great.

80
00:05:13,932 --> 00:05:16,162
-It's down to me and two other guys.
-Oh, my God!

81
00:05:16,252 --> 00:05:18,402
I know both of them,
and they're really good.

82
00:05:18,492 --> 00:05:21,529
One's from those allergy commercials
who's always being chased...

83
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:24,445
-...by those big flowers.
-Oh, I love that guy!

84
00:05:25,332 --> 00:05:27,402
What are you doing?

85
00:05:27,572 --> 00:05:29,164
What am I doing?

86
00:05:30,852 --> 00:05:34,561
I'm so nervous, you know?
The callback isn't 'til tomorrow at 5:00.

87
00:05:34,692 --> 00:05:36,569
I feel like my head's gonna explode.

88
00:05:36,652 --> 00:05:38,370
Well, it is overdue.

89
00:05:39,492 --> 00:05:41,483
Don't worry, okay? You're gonna be fine.

90
00:05:41,572 --> 00:05:43,369
Yeah, but it's so much pressure.

91
00:05:43,452 --> 00:05:46,171
No offense, but what you guys all do
is very different.

92
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:47,884
I don't know if you'd understand.

93
00:05:48,012 --> 00:05:51,209
Yeah, none of the rest of us
have to deal with pressure at our jobs.

94
00:05:51,292 --> 00:05:56,082
Yes, I know what time it is, but I'm looking
at the wee-ness and I'm not happy.

95
00:05:57,452 --> 00:05:59,488
Well, I'm tearing the lettuce.

96
00:06:00,172 --> 00:06:02,561
-Is it dirty?
-No, don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.

97
00:06:02,652 --> 00:06:04,722
Don't. I like it dirty.

98
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,845
That's your call.

99
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,250
So, what are you going to do next?

100
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,091
Well, I thought
that I would cut up the tomatoes.

101
00:06:15,172 --> 00:06:17,083
Are they firm?

102
00:06:19,172 --> 00:06:20,321
They're all right.

103
00:06:20,452 --> 00:06:24,764
You sure they haven't gone bad?
You sure they're not very, very bad?

104
00:06:28,172 --> 00:06:29,924
No, really. They're okay.

105
00:06:30,092 --> 00:06:32,526
You gonna slice 'em up real nice?

106
00:06:32,652 --> 00:06:35,212
Actually, I was gonna do them julienne.

107
00:06:37,172 --> 00:06:38,400
I'm out of here.

108
00:06:38,492 --> 00:06:42,087
Monica, I'm quitting. I just helped
an 81-year-old woman put on a thong...

109
00:06:42,212 --> 00:06:44,123
...and she didn't even buy it.

110
00:06:44,812 --> 00:06:47,929
I'm quitting. That's it.
I'm talking to my boss right now.

111
00:06:48,012 --> 00:06:50,048
Yes, I am. Yes, I am.

112
00:06:51,012 --> 00:06:53,242
Okay, bye.
Call me when you get this message.

113
00:06:53,332 --> 00:06:54,811
Well, what happened?

114
00:06:54,892 --> 00:06:58,885
Well, he came in for a massage,
and everything was fine until....

115
00:07:02,252 --> 00:07:03,844
Oh, my God.

116
00:07:04,052 --> 00:07:07,283
And all of a sudden,
his hands weren't the problem anymore.

117
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:15,049
-Was it?
-Boy Scouts could've camped under there.

118
00:07:16,652 --> 00:07:18,131
You ate my sandwich.

119
00:07:18,252 --> 00:07:20,891
It was a simple mistake.
It could happen to anyone.

120
00:07:20,972 --> 00:07:21,961
Really?

121
00:07:23,452 --> 00:07:25,044
Now calm down.

122
00:07:25,332 --> 00:07:28,688
Come look in my office.
Some of it may still be in the trash.

123
00:07:30,452 --> 00:07:32,568
-What?
-Well, it was quite large.

124
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,961
I had to throw most of it away.

125
00:07:36,492 --> 00:07:39,450
You threw my sandwich away?

126
00:07:40,292 --> 00:07:42,169
My sandwich?

127
00:07:42,292 --> 00:07:45,170
My sandwich!

128
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:49,126
It's just, I want this part so much,
you know?

129
00:07:49,372 --> 00:07:53,331
If I don't get this part, I'm never gonna eat
macaroni and cheese again.

130
00:07:53,452 --> 00:07:55,966
No, I didn't say that. That doesn't count.

131
00:07:59,852 --> 00:08:02,844
Come on, guys.
It's not like I moved to Europe.

132
00:08:02,932 --> 00:08:04,888
I just moved across the hall.

133
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:07,202
And we would have you over all the time...

134
00:08:07,292 --> 00:08:10,887
...if it weren't for Monica's allergies.

135
00:08:12,652 --> 00:08:14,961
You're right, I could never lie to you.

136
00:08:15,052 --> 00:08:16,405
She hates you.

137
00:08:18,612 --> 00:08:20,011
Should I get that?

138
00:08:22,652 --> 00:08:25,883
Hello? No, Joey's not here right now.

139
00:08:26,012 --> 00:08:27,604
Can I take a message?

140
00:08:27,692 --> 00:08:31,241
Yeah, okay. So the audition's been moved
from 5:00 to 2:30?

141
00:08:31,332 --> 00:08:33,243
Okay, great. Bye.

142
00:08:42,292 --> 00:08:45,602
-Aren't you dressed yet?
-Am I naked again?

143
00:08:47,172 --> 00:08:49,527
We're supposed to meet my parents
in 15 minutes.

144
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,285
Okay. I was just talkin' to the guys.
Just look at 'em.

145
00:08:52,372 --> 00:08:54,647
I mean, is it okay if they come visit?

146
00:08:54,812 --> 00:08:57,167
What about my allergies?

147
00:08:57,252 --> 00:08:59,925
Right. Your allergies.

148
00:09:02,052 --> 00:09:04,008
All her. She hates you.

149
00:09:15,492 --> 00:09:17,767
Yes! All right.

150
00:09:18,932 --> 00:09:23,005
How cool would it be if you could watch
like a real life-size version of this?

151
00:09:23,132 --> 00:09:26,329
-I mean, how crazy would that be?
-As crazy as soccer?

152
00:09:31,172 --> 00:09:32,161
Hello?

153
00:09:33,492 --> 00:09:36,643
What are you talkin' about?
The audition's not 'til 5:00.

154
00:09:39,332 --> 00:09:41,129
Well, nobody told me.

155
00:09:41,772 --> 00:09:43,205
Who'd you talk to?

156
00:09:47,572 --> 00:09:48,687
Never mind.

157
00:09:49,692 --> 00:09:52,126
You mean you didn't get it from this?

158
00:09:52,572 --> 00:09:55,040
The allergy guy got the part. Thanks.

159
00:09:55,132 --> 00:09:56,770
Maybe we can fix it, you know?

160
00:09:56,892 --> 00:10:00,407
Maybe we can send him
some big, big flowers and scare him!

161
00:10:01,052 --> 00:10:02,565
How could you do this to me?

162
00:10:02,652 --> 00:10:05,041
This part could've turned
my whole career around.

163
00:10:05,132 --> 00:10:08,204
I messed up, okay?
I'm sorry. I really messed up.

164
00:10:08,292 --> 00:10:11,090
You don't even live here anymore.
Why'd you answer my phone?

165
00:10:11,172 --> 00:10:13,606
-I have a machine!
-Which I bought for ya.

166
00:10:14,532 --> 00:10:17,888
Taught ya how to use it.
You thought it was a copier.

167
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:21,925
If there was anything I could do,
I would do it, okay?

168
00:10:22,012 --> 00:10:24,480
But everybody's allowed
one mistake, right?

169
00:10:24,732 --> 00:10:26,370
He could have gotten me a VCR.

170
00:10:26,452 --> 00:10:28,044
He could have gotten me golf clubs.

171
00:10:28,132 --> 00:10:30,726
But no, he has to get me
the "Woman Repeller."

172
00:10:31,492 --> 00:10:34,086
The eyesore from
the "Liberace House of Crap! "

173
00:10:34,932 --> 00:10:36,888
-It's not that bad.
-Easy for you to say.

174
00:10:36,972 --> 00:10:39,964
You don't have to sport a reject
from the "Mr. T" collection.

175
00:10:40,052 --> 00:10:41,405
Chandler. Chandler.

176
00:10:41,492 --> 00:10:44,689
I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry!
I do! I do!

177
00:10:45,132 --> 00:10:46,963
I pity the fool that....

178
00:10:48,572 --> 00:10:52,201
When you were late last night,
Kathy and I got to talking and...

179
00:10:52,492 --> 00:10:54,801
...one thing led to another and....

180
00:10:55,292 --> 00:10:57,647
And what? Did you sleep with her?

181
00:10:57,732 --> 00:11:01,407
-No! No, I just kissed her.
-What? That's even worse!

182
00:11:02,612 --> 00:11:05,285
-How is that worse?
-I don't know! But it's the same!

183
00:11:05,372 --> 00:11:08,523
You're right, I have no excuses.
I was totally over the line.

184
00:11:08,692 --> 00:11:10,091
"Over the line?"

185
00:11:10,172 --> 00:11:13,323
You're so far past the line
that you can't even see the line!

186
00:11:13,412 --> 00:11:15,368
Yeah, the line is a dot to you!

187
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,686
I'm not saying that you should
magically forgive me.

188
00:11:18,772 --> 00:11:22,447
But you're not perfect.
You've made some errors in judgment, too.

189
00:11:22,692 --> 00:11:23,761
Name one!

190
00:11:25,212 --> 00:11:26,691
What happened?

191
00:11:27,252 --> 00:11:30,449
Man! He promised
he wouldn't take the chairs!

192
00:11:30,932 --> 00:11:33,207
What the hell happened?
How were you locked in?

193
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,567
And where the hell's all of our stuff?

194
00:11:36,012 --> 00:11:38,003
This guy came by to look at the unit...

195
00:11:38,092 --> 00:11:41,402
...and he said he didn't think
it was big enough to fit a grown man.

196
00:11:41,772 --> 00:11:44,002
So you got in voluntarily?

197
00:11:44,172 --> 00:11:46,367
I was tryin' to make a sale!

198
00:11:47,212 --> 00:11:50,409
Man, if I ever run into that guy again,
you know what I'm gonna do?

199
00:11:50,492 --> 00:11:51,641
Bend over?

200
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:54,241
There's Lori.

201
00:11:54,332 --> 00:11:58,325
Okay, now remember, no trading.
You get the pretty one, I get the mess.

202
00:11:58,892 --> 00:12:00,564
-Hi, Joey.
-Hey.

203
00:12:03,252 --> 00:12:06,449
Well, well. Look what you brought.

204
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:08,410
And what did you bring?

205
00:12:10,332 --> 00:12:12,163
She's checking her coat.

206
00:12:12,252 --> 00:12:15,483
Joey, I'm gonna go wash
the cab smell off my hands.

207
00:12:15,612 --> 00:12:19,082
Will you get me a white Zinfandel
and a glass of red for Janice.

208
00:12:23,932 --> 00:12:24,967
Janice?

209
00:12:29,372 --> 00:12:32,921
Oh, my God!

210
00:12:34,372 --> 00:12:36,886
Joey's tailor took advantage of me.

211
00:12:38,452 --> 00:12:39,487
What?

212
00:12:39,572 --> 00:12:42,882
No way. I've been goin'
to the guy for 12 years.

213
00:12:42,972 --> 00:12:44,849
You said he was gonna do my inseam...

214
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:48,641
...then he ran his hand up my leg
and then there was definite....

215
00:12:48,732 --> 00:12:49,881
What?

216
00:12:50,532 --> 00:12:51,681
Cupping.

217
00:12:54,972 --> 00:12:57,361
That's how they do pants!

218
00:12:58,932 --> 00:13:00,001
Ross, will you tell him?

219
00:13:00,092 --> 00:13:03,880
-Isn't that how a tailor measures pants?
-Yes, yes, it is. In prison!

220
00:13:07,132 --> 00:13:08,406
I said name one!

221
00:13:15,372 --> 00:13:19,365
-I can't believe I did this. What an idiot!
-Stop beating yourself up.

222
00:13:19,612 --> 00:13:22,046
People make mistakes.
These things happen.

223
00:13:23,612 --> 00:13:27,127
I hope there aren't any messages
you've forgotten to give me, are there?

224
00:13:27,492 --> 00:13:29,881
Apparently, you're not very good at it.

225
00:13:30,372 --> 00:13:33,125
-Do you think he'll ever forgive me?
-Of course he will.

226
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:36,204
Chandler, the most important thing
is that you forgive yourself.

227
00:13:36,492 --> 00:13:39,165
-You know what, I kind of have.
-Already?

228
00:13:39,492 --> 00:13:41,562
That was pretty bad what you did.

229
00:13:42,212 --> 00:13:44,043
You know what? He will forgive you.

230
00:13:44,172 --> 00:13:48,529
I like to bring a pad with me when I go
answer the phone, just in case. Okay?

231
00:13:48,692 --> 00:13:50,683
You didn't see how mad he was,
you know?

232
00:13:50,772 --> 00:13:52,330
I'm sure he will forgive you.

233
00:13:52,412 --> 00:13:55,324
Look, we've all been there, you know?
You fight, you make up.

234
00:13:55,412 --> 00:13:56,527
That's the way it works.

235
00:13:56,972 --> 00:13:59,805
It took two people to break up
this relationship!

236
00:13:59,892 --> 00:14:01,962
Yeah! You and that girl from
the copy place...

237
00:14:02,052 --> 00:14:04,725
...which yesterday you took
full responsibility for!

238
00:14:04,812 --> 00:14:07,770
I didn't know what I was taking
responsibility for, okay?

239
00:14:07,852 --> 00:14:09,570
I didn't finish the whole letter.

240
00:14:09,652 --> 00:14:11,165
-What?
-I fell asleep.

241
00:14:11,292 --> 00:14:13,203
You fell asleep?

242
00:14:14,052 --> 00:14:17,044
It was 5:30 in the morning.

243
00:14:17,172 --> 00:14:21,688
And you had rambled on for 18 pages.

244
00:14:23,252 --> 00:14:24,810
Front and back!

245
00:14:27,052 --> 00:14:31,762
And by the way?
Y-O-U, apostrophe R-E means, "you are."

246
00:14:31,892 --> 00:14:34,042
Y-O-U-R means "your."

247
00:14:34,532 --> 00:14:37,410
I can't believe I thought
of getting back together with you.

248
00:14:37,492 --> 00:14:39,323
We are so over!

249
00:14:41,052 --> 00:14:42,201
Fine by me!

250
00:14:43,932 --> 00:14:47,049
And just so you know,
it's not that common...

251
00:14:47,172 --> 00:14:50,369
...it doesn't happen to every guy,
and it is a big deal!

252
00:14:51,852 --> 00:14:53,285
I knew it!

253
00:14:54,412 --> 00:14:56,209
You had no right to go out with him.

254
00:14:56,292 --> 00:14:57,884
That is the most ridiculous--

255
00:14:57,972 --> 00:14:59,963
-You sold me out!
-I did not sell you out!

256
00:15:00,052 --> 00:15:03,522
-Yes, you did! You absolutely sold me--
-Would you let me talk?

257
00:15:06,052 --> 00:15:08,088
Did you just flick me?

258
00:15:09,132 --> 00:15:11,851
Okay, well you wouldn't let me finish
and I was just--

259
00:15:11,932 --> 00:15:13,251
Stop it!

260
00:15:14,652 --> 00:15:15,880
-Stop.
-Stop.

261
00:15:16,012 --> 00:15:19,129
-All right. No, let's not do this.
-No!

262
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:22,168
-Happy thoughts.
-No!

263
00:15:23,332 --> 00:15:25,323
-Happy thoughts.
-No!

264
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,722
Okay, now I'm gonna kick some ass!

265
00:15:36,732 --> 00:15:40,691
All right. Now, I will let go
if you both stop.

266
00:15:41,572 --> 00:15:43,164
-Fine.
-Fine.

267
00:15:43,812 --> 00:15:45,211
There we go.

268
00:15:46,732 --> 00:15:50,725
You know what? lf we were in prison,
you guys would be, like, my bitches.

269
00:15:58,492 --> 00:16:00,608
Okay, buddy boy, here it is.

270
00:16:01,332 --> 00:16:04,881
You hide my clothes?
I'm wearin' everything you own.

271
00:16:05,452 --> 00:16:07,204
Oh, my God!

272
00:16:07,812 --> 00:16:11,566
Look at me, I'm Chandler!
Could I be wearin' any more clothes?

273
00:16:13,892 --> 00:16:16,360
Maybe if I wasn't going "commando".

274
00:16:19,892 --> 00:16:24,568
I tell ya, it's hot with all this stuff on.
I'd better not do any lunges.

275
00:16:30,732 --> 00:16:33,849
"I think of all the friends I've known

276
00:16:36,932 --> 00:16:39,844
"But when I dial the telephone

277
00:16:42,092 --> 00:16:44,322
"Nobody's home

278
00:16:52,572 --> 00:16:56,247
"All by myself

279
00:16:58,612 --> 00:17:04,562
"Don't want to be
all by myself

280
00:17:05,452 --> 00:17:07,090
"Anymore

281
00:17:08,412 --> 00:17:11,290
"All by myself"

282
00:17:15,012 --> 00:17:16,127
Joey?

283
00:17:17,212 --> 00:17:20,682
Got you the Joey special! Two pizzas!

284
00:17:24,692 --> 00:17:26,648
Hello? Damn it!

285
00:17:28,812 --> 00:17:29,801
Hello?

286
00:17:30,172 --> 00:17:33,767
No, Joey's not here right now,
but I can take a message. I think.

287
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:38,328
He's still got a chance for the part?
That's great news!

288
00:17:38,612 --> 00:17:42,287
Well, no, obviously not for the actor
who was mauled by his dog.

289
00:17:43,172 --> 00:17:46,164
Well, that's great.
I will give Joey the message. Thank you.

290
00:17:46,252 --> 00:17:47,241
Yes!

291
00:17:48,612 --> 00:17:49,601
Okay.

292
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:51,326
Mac...

293
00:17:51,972 --> 00:17:53,610
...audition...

294
00:17:54,412 --> 00:17:56,289
...at 2:00.

295
00:17:57,492 --> 00:17:58,845
Allergy...

296
00:17:59,372 --> 00:18:00,566
...actor...

297
00:18:01,692 --> 00:18:03,205
...attacked.

298
00:18:07,972 --> 00:18:10,247
By dog...

299
00:18:10,652 --> 00:18:12,005
...not...

300
00:18:12,372 --> 00:18:13,885
...flowers.

301
00:18:22,532 --> 00:18:24,727
Please tell me you got the message.

302
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,406
-What message?
-The actor playing Mac couldn't do it.

303
00:18:27,492 --> 00:18:31,246
-They needed to see you at 2:00.
-What? It's 6:00!

304
00:18:31,332 --> 00:18:33,800
Look! I wrote it! I wrote it on the board!

305
00:18:33,892 --> 00:18:36,531
I wrote it down,
then went lookin' all over for ya!

306
00:18:36,612 --> 00:18:38,489
I went to Ross's, the coffee house....

307
00:18:38,572 --> 00:18:41,325
I went to any place
that they make sandwiches!

308
00:18:41,932 --> 00:18:44,685
-I can't believe this, Chandler!
-I'm sorry.

309
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:47,050
I don't know what to say!

310
00:18:47,172 --> 00:18:50,164
You might say, "Congratulations! "

311
00:18:50,332 --> 00:18:53,927
I saw the board, I went to the audition,
I got the part!

312
00:18:54,812 --> 00:18:57,451
Was that supposed to be funny?
I was worried over here.

313
00:18:57,532 --> 00:19:01,002
-I'm sorry.
-At times that fake-out thing is just mean.

314
00:19:01,172 --> 00:19:04,050
Okay, man. I'm sorry.
I did not mean to make you feel bad.

315
00:19:04,132 --> 00:19:05,451
Well, that's good.

316
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:08,763
Because ya didn't!
And I'm incredibly happy for ya!

317
00:19:09,572 --> 00:19:10,846
That's mean!

318
00:19:12,532 --> 00:19:15,126
-You had me goin' there!
-We could do this all day.

319
00:19:15,212 --> 00:19:16,645
Yeah, you're right.

320
00:19:17,452 --> 00:19:20,012
Look, let's talk about
what a huge star I'm gonna be.

321
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,322
You are gonna be a huge star!
I'm gonna hug ya!

322
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:24,084
-You hug me!
-All right.

323
00:19:25,692 --> 00:19:28,843
"You've really got a hold on me

324
00:19:28,932 --> 00:19:31,969
"You've really got a hold on me

325
00:19:37,132 --> 00:19:38,451
"Baby!

326
00:19:39,372 --> 00:19:41,488
"I love you

327
00:19:41,652 --> 00:19:46,282
"And all I want you to do is just
Hold me

328
00:19:46,372 --> 00:19:47,361
"Please

329
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:49,408
"Squeeze me, hold me"

330
00:19:51,972 --> 00:19:54,691
-Do we do this too much?
-I think so.

331
00:19:54,892 --> 00:19:56,769
-Yeah. Get off me.
-Yeah.

332
00:20:04,052 --> 00:20:06,520
"Come on, C.H.E.E.S.E.,
I'm not leaving without you.

333
00:20:06,612 --> 00:20:09,729
"Try routing your backup power source
through your primary CPU."

334
00:20:09,812 --> 00:20:14,090
"I can't! My circuits are fried!
They're fried, I tell you! "

335
00:20:18,332 --> 00:20:20,209
"Well, then I'll just have to carry you! "

336
00:20:20,492 --> 00:20:22,403
"That'll be a neat trick...

337
00:20:23,372 --> 00:20:24,964
"...when you're dead! "

338
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:28,650
Ross, you don't have to yell.

339
00:20:28,732 --> 00:20:32,611
There was just an explosion, okay?
My hearing would be impaired.

340
00:20:33,772 --> 00:20:35,330
I thought you were excellent.

341
00:20:35,452 --> 00:20:38,410
In fact, for a minute there, I was like,
"Where did Ross go?"

342
00:20:39,532 --> 00:20:43,047
Thank you. And I have to say
that first scene where you meet Mac....

343
00:20:43,172 --> 00:20:45,083
-Yeah?
-Oh, my God. I mean....

344
00:20:45,372 --> 00:20:46,521
And you know what?

345
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:49,604
I think that's enough for today.
Thanks for your help.

346
00:20:51,852 --> 00:20:54,127
-Holding us back.
-Totally.
