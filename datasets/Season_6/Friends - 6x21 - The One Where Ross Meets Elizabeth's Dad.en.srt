1
00:00:02,212 --> 00:00:03,611
-Okay, Chandler.
-Okay.

2
00:00:03,692 --> 00:00:05,489
And your horoscope says:

3
00:00:05,652 --> 00:00:09,042
"On the 5th,
a special someone will give you a gift."

4
00:00:09,132 --> 00:00:11,043
Well, thank you in advance.

5
00:00:11,732 --> 00:00:14,292
"But the 12th brings a lover's spat."

6
00:00:14,452 --> 00:00:16,920
You're going to make a joke
about my special present.

7
00:00:17,852 --> 00:00:19,410
Why would you do that?

8
00:00:20,292 --> 00:00:24,808
Wait. "On the 19th,
a secret crush announces itself."

9
00:00:30,372 --> 00:00:31,566
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

10
00:00:31,652 --> 00:00:34,849
Oh, my God! It's Joey Tribbiani
of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.

11
00:00:36,692 --> 00:00:38,648
That's right. It's your first day.

12
00:00:38,732 --> 00:00:41,963
Are you psyched to fight fake crime
with your robot sidekick?

13
00:00:42,052 --> 00:00:44,646
Am I psyched?
The lead in my own TV series?

14
00:00:44,772 --> 00:00:46,842
I've dreamed about this for years!

15
00:00:47,452 --> 00:00:49,408
Why have I not been preparing?

16
00:00:50,732 --> 00:00:52,563
Joey, you're gonna be great.

17
00:00:52,692 --> 00:00:56,446
But I gotta act with a robot.
I don't know anything about technology.

18
00:00:56,572 --> 00:00:59,769
I can't even use Chandler's computer,
except to find porn.

19
00:01:00,612 --> 00:01:03,604
And that's only because
it's there when you turn it on.

20
00:01:05,412 --> 00:01:08,290
Our lover's spat will start
a little early this month.

21
00:01:08,372 --> 00:01:09,691
I'll be waiting.

22
00:01:11,732 --> 00:01:14,292
The One Where Ross Meets Elizabeth's Dad

23
00:01:14,852 --> 00:01:15,841
English subtitles by Softitler

24
00:01:48,772 --> 00:01:53,050
Are you judging them by their covers?
Because you're really not supposed to.

25
00:01:53,852 --> 00:01:57,322
I'm deciding which one to use.
I'm going to start writing another book.

26
00:01:58,732 --> 00:02:01,246
Because the last one was such a big seller?

27
00:02:01,892 --> 00:02:04,611
Well, if you must know,
I have written 14 books.

28
00:02:05,212 --> 00:02:07,521
And as I'm the only one
who has read them...

29
00:02:07,612 --> 00:02:11,002
...l can tell you that
they have all been very well received.

30
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,411
What are you doing later?

31
00:02:15,492 --> 00:02:17,767
Rachel and I have to get our hair cut.

32
00:02:18,452 --> 00:02:20,602
-We do?
-I want to see what he wants first.

33
00:02:22,212 --> 00:02:24,772
I just found out Elizabeth's dad
wants to meet me.

34
00:02:24,852 --> 00:02:26,729
Wait a minute. Hold the phone.

35
00:02:26,812 --> 00:02:28,564
You're not Elizabeth's dad?

36
00:02:31,772 --> 00:02:34,411
Come on, guys.
I really want this guy to like me.

37
00:02:34,492 --> 00:02:38,485
It would really help me out if you guys
could be here to make me look good.

38
00:02:38,572 --> 00:02:40,563
-Of course we'll help.
-Thanks.

39
00:02:41,092 --> 00:02:44,289
We know how tough
those parent-teacher conferences can be.

40
00:02:48,892 --> 00:02:52,123
-So, here's your office set.
-Wow!

41
00:02:54,572 --> 00:02:56,802
Mac Machiavelli, Private lnvestigator.

42
00:02:57,892 --> 00:03:00,281
Let's get you to wardrobe for a fitting.

43
00:03:00,372 --> 00:03:02,044
When do I meet the robot?

44
00:03:02,332 --> 00:03:04,766
Why don't we do that right now?
He's right here.

45
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:07,283
Joey Tribbiani, this is--

46
00:03:07,372 --> 00:03:10,205
Wow! He's so lifelike.

47
00:03:11,532 --> 00:03:12,601
Unbelievable.

48
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:16,048
This is Wayne, the man who created
and operates C.H.E.E.S.E.

49
00:03:16,252 --> 00:03:18,004
How do you do there, buddy?

50
00:03:18,652 --> 00:03:20,882
I'll let you two guys get acquainted?

51
00:03:20,972 --> 00:03:22,564
Sorry about that.

52
00:03:22,652 --> 00:03:26,691
-So where's C.H.E.E.S.E.?
-C.H.E.E.S.E. is right here.

53
00:03:32,372 --> 00:03:34,124
Nice to meet you, Mac.

54
00:03:37,212 --> 00:03:40,887
-This is the temporary robot, right?
-No. Why?

55
00:03:41,292 --> 00:03:44,523
Well, I just thought it was gonna be
a really cool robot.

56
00:03:44,612 --> 00:03:47,126
Like the Terminator,
or when I first saw you.

57
00:03:48,452 --> 00:03:52,365
I spent two years developing this machine.
It's absolutely state of the art.

58
00:03:52,452 --> 00:03:55,364
Sorry. It doesn't look like
it can do anything.

59
00:03:55,772 --> 00:03:57,000
It can do this.

60
00:04:08,972 --> 00:04:12,681
This is my father, Paul Stevens.
Dad, this is Ross Geller.

61
00:04:12,972 --> 00:04:14,963
It's great to meet you, Paul.

62
00:04:15,092 --> 00:04:18,528
I prefer that Liz's boyfriends address me
as Mr. Stevens.

63
00:04:20,492 --> 00:04:22,130
Of course. Mr. Stevens.

64
00:04:22,772 --> 00:04:23,841
So, Ross...

65
00:04:25,292 --> 00:04:26,771
...what's your problem?

66
00:04:28,652 --> 00:04:29,801
Excuse me?

67
00:04:29,892 --> 00:04:32,201
Why can't you get a girlfriend
your own age?

68
00:04:33,532 --> 00:04:35,284
It's funny....

69
00:04:36,212 --> 00:04:37,440
It's not funny.

70
00:04:37,892 --> 00:04:40,690
I don't like you going out
with my daughter, Ross.

71
00:04:40,772 --> 00:04:43,650
Okay, I can see that.

72
00:04:43,932 --> 00:04:48,164
I think if you give me one chance,
I can change your mind.

73
00:04:48,972 --> 00:04:50,690
-Okay.
-What?

74
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:54,090
Okay. I'll give you one chance
to change my mind.

75
00:04:54,852 --> 00:04:56,410
You've got one minute.

76
00:04:57,732 --> 00:05:01,008
-Daddy.
-Fine. Two minutes. Go.

77
00:05:06,532 --> 00:05:08,170
A minute and 50 seconds.

78
00:05:09,652 --> 00:05:13,247
I want you to know,
I have never done anything like this before.

79
00:05:13,332 --> 00:05:16,483
I mean, I've been in relationships
in general.

80
00:05:16,612 --> 00:05:19,684
But I've never done it with a student.
I mean, not....

81
00:05:21,252 --> 00:05:24,085
Not "it." We haven't done "it."

82
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,683
I mean, we've done stuff....

83
00:05:29,772 --> 00:05:32,889
Okay. A joke. Lighten the mood.

84
00:05:34,012 --> 00:05:36,446
Two guys go into a bar.
One of them is lrish.

85
00:05:36,532 --> 00:05:39,444
-I'm lrish.
-And the lrish guy wins the joke.

86
00:05:42,212 --> 00:05:45,045
Ross! How crazy
that we would run into you.

87
00:05:45,452 --> 00:05:47,170
Oh, my God! Thank you.

88
00:05:48,892 --> 00:05:53,010
I 'd like you to meet my friends.
This is Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler.

89
00:05:53,372 --> 00:05:56,842
So you're Elizabeth's father?
I can see now where she gets her...

90
00:05:58,012 --> 00:05:59,650
...rugged handsomeness.

91
00:06:02,092 --> 00:06:03,684
Is there a Mrs. Stevens?

92
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:06,765
There's a Mr. Bing!

93
00:06:08,972 --> 00:06:12,567
Unfortunately, Lizzie's mom passed away
shortly after she was born.

94
00:06:13,292 --> 00:06:14,805
I raised her by myself.

95
00:06:16,212 --> 00:06:17,565
I get that a lot.

96
00:06:19,492 --> 00:06:22,086
Why don't we all take a seat?

97
00:06:22,172 --> 00:06:25,403
I'll get us all some coffees.

98
00:06:25,732 --> 00:06:27,211
Yeah, why don't you....

99
00:06:28,292 --> 00:06:30,852
And you guys can talk about
whatever you want.

100
00:06:30,972 --> 00:06:33,725
Whatever pops into your head.

101
00:06:35,532 --> 00:06:38,205
It is so strange seeing Ross here,
this time of day...

102
00:06:38,292 --> 00:06:41,011
...because usually
he's at the children's hospital.

103
00:06:42,372 --> 00:06:44,090
But not looking for dates.

104
00:06:47,692 --> 00:06:50,252
Monica is Ross' sister.

105
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,170
He's a great brother!

106
00:06:52,252 --> 00:06:53,480
I had a sister.

107
00:06:54,212 --> 00:06:55,531
She passed away.

108
00:06:55,972 --> 00:06:58,202
You don't have to do that every time.

109
00:06:58,772 --> 00:07:02,731
But Ross is a great guy.
I was roommates with him in college.

110
00:07:02,932 --> 00:07:04,160
Funny story....

111
00:07:05,612 --> 00:07:08,046
Your roommate in college died, didn't he?

112
00:07:10,172 --> 00:07:11,810
A part of him did, yes.

113
00:07:12,972 --> 00:07:14,963
Here we are, Paul, Elizabeth.

114
00:07:15,092 --> 00:07:17,686
I hope you guys are finding
something to talk about.

115
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:19,728
-Yes. We were just--
-Sorry I'm late.

116
00:07:19,812 --> 00:07:22,929
But I am ready to talk you up.

117
00:07:23,532 --> 00:07:25,170
When does Liz's father get here?

118
00:07:25,252 --> 00:07:26,446
I'm already here.

119
00:07:26,532 --> 00:07:28,523
Ross is so great!

120
00:07:33,492 --> 00:07:35,767
Honey, you got the kind with the little girl.

121
00:07:35,852 --> 00:07:38,002
You said we would get the kind
with the baby.

122
00:07:38,092 --> 00:07:41,164
-You said the baby creeps you out.
-The little girl does.

123
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,766
-You said, "the baby."
-Why would the baby creep me out?

124
00:07:43,852 --> 00:07:46,241
Why would the little girl creep you out?

125
00:07:46,572 --> 00:07:49,040
I'm sorry.
Can you please talk a little slower.

126
00:07:49,132 --> 00:07:51,441
-This is for your book?
-It's about relationships.

127
00:07:51,532 --> 00:07:54,126
You know, the traps, the pitfalls,
what not to do.

128
00:07:54,212 --> 00:07:56,282
Keep going. This stuff's great.

129
00:07:57,012 --> 00:07:58,081
Excuse me.

130
00:07:58,772 --> 00:08:02,367
And how none of it matters
when the people really love each other.

131
00:08:04,052 --> 00:08:08,364
And how people will believe anything
you tell them as long as it's a compliment.

132
00:08:14,492 --> 00:08:16,084
-Oh, hi!
-Hi.

133
00:08:17,052 --> 00:08:20,362
-I left my keys here somewhere.
-Well, let's look for them.

134
00:08:22,052 --> 00:08:23,849
Hey, look! Are these them?

135
00:08:26,012 --> 00:08:26,808
No.

136
00:08:28,372 --> 00:08:29,361
All right.

137
00:08:31,732 --> 00:08:33,245
-Here they are.
-Good.

138
00:08:33,332 --> 00:08:35,209
-Thanks for your help.
-Wait! Sorry!

139
00:08:35,292 --> 00:08:37,203
-Mr. Paul?
-Just call me Paul.

140
00:08:37,292 --> 00:08:40,250
Paul. I just wanted you to know that...

141
00:08:40,372 --> 00:08:42,567
...Ross really is a great guy.

142
00:08:42,652 --> 00:08:46,565
Maybe you could date him then.
It would save me the trouble of killing him.

143
00:08:51,172 --> 00:08:52,048
Are you okay?

144
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:55,090
You just don't look old enough
to have a 20-year-old daughter.

145
00:08:55,172 --> 00:08:57,561
Well, we were very young
when we had her.

146
00:08:57,732 --> 00:08:58,528
We?

147
00:08:58,612 --> 00:09:01,046
Yeah, it usually takes two people to....

148
00:09:01,532 --> 00:09:04,046
Oh, no! Yes! Of course. I know that!

149
00:09:04,172 --> 00:09:07,721
What I meant was are you still "we"
or are you just you?

150
00:09:09,052 --> 00:09:10,201
I'm just me.

151
00:09:10,972 --> 00:09:13,486
My wife died shortly after Lizzie was born.

152
00:09:14,852 --> 00:09:16,968
So you raised her all on your own?

153
00:09:17,212 --> 00:09:18,361
Yes, I did.

154
00:09:25,012 --> 00:09:26,206
How was your first day?

155
00:09:26,292 --> 00:09:29,364
Pretty good. Except I got
a little attitude from the robot.

156
00:09:29,452 --> 00:09:32,967
Damn those robots. They're supposed
to be our faithful servants!

157
00:09:34,092 --> 00:09:36,401
It was the guy who controls the robot.

158
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:39,962
He doesn't like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E.
knock over the sandwich table...

159
00:09:40,052 --> 00:09:42,168
...right when I was reaching for one.

160
00:09:42,252 --> 00:09:43,970
Why don't you get him fired?

161
00:09:44,052 --> 00:09:47,488
I may have to. I hate to do it.
But I'm the star, you know?

162
00:09:47,852 --> 00:09:51,288
There's a limit to how many sandwiches
I can eat off the floor.

163
00:09:52,732 --> 00:09:53,801
Excuse me.

164
00:09:55,212 --> 00:09:56,440
Joey Tribbiani.

165
00:09:57,572 --> 00:10:01,008
Joe! I'm glad I found you!
I got an audition for you.

166
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:04,122
The thing is, it's kind of on the q.t.

167
00:10:04,292 --> 00:10:07,887
The actor who has the part
doesn't know he might be fired.

168
00:10:08,452 --> 00:10:10,044
It's the lead in a series.

169
00:10:10,132 --> 00:10:11,690
Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.

170
00:10:13,732 --> 00:10:16,166
I'm the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.

171
00:10:20,532 --> 00:10:21,408
Joey?

172
00:10:23,692 --> 00:10:24,727
Hi, Ross.

173
00:10:28,012 --> 00:10:30,162
I was just getting him to like you.

174
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:39,087
Joey!

175
00:10:42,572 --> 00:10:44,210
Ross, Joey is not here.

176
00:10:44,452 --> 00:10:46,408
I'll just wait for him in here!

177
00:10:46,732 --> 00:10:49,166
Ross, it's okay. You can come out.

178
00:10:49,332 --> 00:10:51,209
Yeah. It's okay. It's me...

179
00:10:52,012 --> 00:10:53,240
...Mr. Stevens.

180
00:10:54,812 --> 00:10:58,327
I didn't.... Oh, my gosh.
I didn't even see you.

181
00:10:59,052 --> 00:11:02,089
You did. You came in, got all awkward
and ran to the bedroom.

182
00:11:02,172 --> 00:11:03,844
You were shouting, "Joey! "

183
00:11:06,372 --> 00:11:07,771
-Bye, Rachel.
-Bye.

184
00:11:07,852 --> 00:11:09,001
I'll call you later.

185
00:11:09,092 --> 00:11:10,525
-See ya!
-Bye, Ross.

186
00:11:13,532 --> 00:11:16,968
What? What the.... How did.... What?

187
00:11:18,172 --> 00:11:22,131
You know, he lost his keys.
So he was looking for them.

188
00:11:22,212 --> 00:11:23,406
In your mouth?

189
00:11:26,012 --> 00:11:26,808
No!

190
00:11:27,572 --> 00:11:29,608
Downstairs. And we got to talking...

191
00:11:29,692 --> 00:11:33,526
...for two hours. I liked him.
I invited him for a cup of coffee.

192
00:11:33,812 --> 00:11:36,042
You were at the coffee house!

193
00:11:38,132 --> 00:11:40,521
What's the big deal? So I kissed the guy?

194
00:11:40,812 --> 00:11:44,407
He's my girlfriend's father. It's weird!

195
00:11:44,732 --> 00:11:48,042
-You dated my sister!
-That was different!

196
00:11:48,132 --> 00:11:51,169
-What? Why?
-This is weird for me!

197
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,767
Ross, look. This is good for you.

198
00:11:55,972 --> 00:11:58,691
Let's face it.
So far the guy's not loving ya.

199
00:11:59,212 --> 00:12:02,204
But I can turn that around.
I've got the inside track.

200
00:12:02,612 --> 00:12:05,684
We could all go out to dinner.
And I could talk you up.

201
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:09,967
Plus the guy is a very successful lawyer!

202
00:12:10,972 --> 00:12:13,566
-How is that important?
-It's important!

203
00:12:16,412 --> 00:12:19,165
There's a million guys
out there who can play Mac...

204
00:12:19,252 --> 00:12:20,605
...and there's only one robot.

205
00:12:20,692 --> 00:12:24,287
And this one guy who controls it.
I didn't know he could get me fired.

206
00:12:24,372 --> 00:12:25,521
What am I gonna do?

207
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:28,206
You're a pretty charming guy.

208
00:12:28,812 --> 00:12:31,007
Thanks. But I have a problem to deal with.

209
00:12:31,092 --> 00:12:34,448
No, sweetie. You've got to win over
the guy who controls C.H.E.E.S.E.

210
00:12:34,532 --> 00:12:37,330
Go back there
and kiss some serious robot ass!

211
00:12:39,172 --> 00:12:40,730
That's not a bad idea!

212
00:12:41,412 --> 00:12:45,405
If I have to turn on the charm tomorrow,
I'm not wasting any of it on you guys.

213
00:12:46,252 --> 00:12:48,322
I got some saved for you, Pheebs.

214
00:12:52,412 --> 00:12:54,767
Do you think Joey is
more charming than me?

215
00:12:54,852 --> 00:12:57,320
Yeah. That's why I'm sleeping
with him on the side.

216
00:12:57,412 --> 00:12:58,527
You wish.

217
00:13:02,572 --> 00:13:03,607
"You wish."

218
00:13:04,732 --> 00:13:06,051
Stop writing about us.

219
00:13:06,132 --> 00:13:09,329
I'm not writing about you.
I'm writing about other people.

220
00:13:10,692 --> 00:13:12,842
-Who?
-Marsha and Chester.

221
00:13:14,372 --> 00:13:18,331
Fine. Then you know what?
I will just write about Phyllis.

222
00:13:19,572 --> 00:13:22,848
-"Phyllis is sitting in the chair."
-I see what you're doing.

223
00:13:22,932 --> 00:13:24,923
"Phyllis sees what I'm doing."

224
00:13:27,092 --> 00:13:29,925
I have tasted my own medicine
and it is bitter!

225
00:13:36,652 --> 00:13:37,846
Morning!

226
00:13:38,292 --> 00:13:40,852
How's my favorite genius
and his robot buddy?

227
00:13:40,932 --> 00:13:43,002
-Don't touch him!
-Okay.

228
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:48,965
Level with me. I keep hearing
all these rumors that I might get fired.

229
00:13:49,252 --> 00:13:52,164
They even have actors coming in
to read for my part.

230
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:55,051
Come on, man.
You gotta give me a second chance.

231
00:13:55,132 --> 00:13:56,770
I love this little guy.

232
00:13:58,732 --> 00:14:01,530
That's why you didn't want me
to touch him, right?

233
00:14:03,812 --> 00:14:06,087
I can't believe this! God!

234
00:14:08,572 --> 00:14:10,005
Hey, how are you doing?

235
00:14:15,652 --> 00:14:18,883
So it seemed that my prom date
had stood me up.

236
00:14:19,252 --> 00:14:22,881
So Ross selflessly offered to take me.

237
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:25,005
What a nice story.

238
00:14:25,812 --> 00:14:27,370
So Ross was in college...

239
00:14:27,532 --> 00:14:31,320
...and decided to jump at the chance
to take a young girl to her prom.

240
00:14:33,892 --> 00:14:36,884
I definitely did not see that one backfiring.

241
00:14:37,812 --> 00:14:40,326
-I'm going to the bathroom.
-Take your time.

242
00:14:43,252 --> 00:14:47,370
I was a freshman and she was a senior.
So it wasn't as bad as--

243
00:14:47,572 --> 00:14:50,405
Look. I know I've been giving you
a lot of jabs.

244
00:14:51,532 --> 00:14:54,649
It's partly because
I'm very protective of Lizzie...

245
00:14:55,252 --> 00:14:58,722
...and partly because
they just keep coming to me.

246
00:15:01,212 --> 00:15:05,046
I have to admit that after all
the wonderful things Lizzie has told me...

247
00:15:05,132 --> 00:15:08,647
...and the many stories
that Rachel has told me...

248
00:15:11,052 --> 00:15:12,121
...well...

249
00:15:13,532 --> 00:15:14,851
...you're not...

250
00:15:15,972 --> 00:15:17,087
...all bad.

251
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:20,646
"Not all bad."

252
00:15:21,532 --> 00:15:24,683
I'm sorry I was so harsh.
But you have to understand.

253
00:15:25,332 --> 00:15:28,642
I still look at Lizzie
like she's a 12-year-old girl.

254
00:15:29,132 --> 00:15:31,965
I know what you mean. I do that, too.

255
00:15:34,092 --> 00:15:38,529
-I beg your pardon?
-I don't see her as a 12-year-old girl.

256
00:15:38,852 --> 00:15:42,811
I mean, I have a son who is six
and I still think of him as a baby.

257
00:15:42,892 --> 00:15:43,802
You have a son?

258
00:15:44,092 --> 00:15:47,880
My ex-wife and I share custody of Ben.

259
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:51,251
Just so you know,
Carol and I are on excellent terms...

260
00:15:51,332 --> 00:15:53,482
...as I'm sure you are with your wife.

261
00:15:53,812 --> 00:15:54,881
I'm sorry.

262
00:15:56,212 --> 00:15:57,611
It's unbelievable!

263
00:15:58,372 --> 00:16:01,045
Don't worry.
I just didn't realize you were married.

264
00:16:01,132 --> 00:16:03,930
We were. But that was just a....

265
00:16:07,292 --> 00:16:10,011
That was just a big drunken mistake.

266
00:16:13,212 --> 00:16:14,361
You're back.

267
00:16:16,612 --> 00:16:18,091
You two were married?

268
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:21,321
I'm sorry. You were talking about Emily.

269
00:16:24,612 --> 00:16:27,365
We said we would meet
at the coffee house at 6:00.

270
00:16:27,652 --> 00:16:28,880
We said 7:00.

271
00:16:29,252 --> 00:16:30,526
We said 6:00!

272
00:16:30,812 --> 00:16:32,609
The only way that I said 6:00...

273
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:36,765
...would be if I said the sentence,
"Let's meet at 7:00, not at 6:00."

274
00:16:38,012 --> 00:16:40,685
If I had said 7:00, I would have said:

275
00:16:40,772 --> 00:16:43,605
"My boyfriend is such a wiseass. 7:00! "

276
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:47,363
-Hi!
-Oh, my good God!

277
00:16:48,092 --> 00:16:50,128
-I know what time you said.
-What?

278
00:16:50,212 --> 00:16:53,284
Well, actually I know what time
Chester and Marsha said.

279
00:16:54,732 --> 00:16:55,801
What time?

280
00:16:56,012 --> 00:16:57,889
What an interesting turn of events.

281
00:16:57,972 --> 00:17:00,770
Suddenly it's my book to the rescue.
Let's see.

282
00:17:02,452 --> 00:17:03,805
Very interesting.

283
00:17:04,292 --> 00:17:06,522
Well this certainly clears things up.

284
00:17:07,572 --> 00:17:08,687
What does it say?

285
00:17:08,772 --> 00:17:12,082
I will tell you as soon as you thank me
for writing my book.

286
00:17:13,372 --> 00:17:16,489
Thank you for writing your book.
It's a great book...

287
00:17:16,692 --> 00:17:19,445
...and you are the queen of everything.

288
00:17:21,412 --> 00:17:23,084
Thanks. So are you.

289
00:17:28,492 --> 00:17:30,881
I told you I should not wear this color.

290
00:17:34,172 --> 00:17:39,451
"Monica, Marsha and Chester are planning
on seeing a movie Sunday night.

291
00:17:39,972 --> 00:17:43,726
"Marsha thinks they're meeting at 6:00.
Chester thinks it's 7:00."

292
00:17:45,132 --> 00:17:48,124
-You knew we were gonna miss the movie?
-That's right.

293
00:17:48,212 --> 00:17:51,841
Instead of telling us, you decided
to write it in your stupid book?

294
00:17:52,492 --> 00:17:55,325
"Marsha and Chester are mad at Phyllis."

295
00:18:00,892 --> 00:18:02,962
I can't believe I'm gonna lose this job.

296
00:18:03,052 --> 00:18:05,646
I'm so sorry, man.
Is there anything I can do?

297
00:18:05,732 --> 00:18:08,644
Help me get this mini-fridge
past the security guard.

298
00:18:14,652 --> 00:18:16,722
Joey, I want to talk to you.

299
00:18:16,812 --> 00:18:18,882
Yeah? I don't want to talk to you, Wayne.

300
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:20,928
I hate you. You ruined my life.

301
00:18:22,052 --> 00:18:24,805
-Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler.
-Hi. How are you?

302
00:18:24,892 --> 00:18:28,168
Joey, I'll get you your job back
if you help me out.

303
00:18:28,252 --> 00:18:29,970
Why should I help you out?

304
00:18:30,572 --> 00:18:33,370
-The reason he just said.
-What do you need?

305
00:18:35,412 --> 00:18:38,848
I saw you on stage talking
to that beautiful woman.

306
00:18:38,932 --> 00:18:42,163
You know, Sarah.
I wish I could talk to her.

307
00:18:42,572 --> 00:18:44,563
-Are you in love with her?
-Yeah.

308
00:18:45,012 --> 00:18:47,572
Her. All of them. Anyone.

309
00:18:47,652 --> 00:18:49,722
Yeah. I've been there, my friend.

310
00:18:50,772 --> 00:18:53,206
Listen, I guarantee you keep your job...

311
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:56,404
...if you can teach me how to talk
to women like you do.

312
00:18:57,932 --> 00:19:01,402
It's not something you can teach.
It's something you're born with.

313
00:19:01,492 --> 00:19:03,960
You can teach it.
I can show you right now.

314
00:19:05,372 --> 00:19:07,169
Well, if you think about it...

315
00:19:07,252 --> 00:19:10,005
...Ross did learn something
from each marriage.

316
00:19:10,652 --> 00:19:12,927
How to make the next one even shorter?

317
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,924
Wait a minute. That's not fair.

318
00:19:15,012 --> 00:19:18,084
He was married to me a hell of a lot longer
than he was to Emily.

319
00:19:18,172 --> 00:19:19,810
He just didn't tell me.

320
00:19:24,012 --> 00:19:25,730
Maybe I have to pee again.

321
00:19:30,532 --> 00:19:31,931
Well, this is fun.

322
00:19:33,052 --> 00:19:36,124
So Ross, did you kill any of these wives?

323
00:19:38,412 --> 00:19:42,849
I have had enough of this!
I care a great deal about your daughter.

324
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:45,321
And I have treated her
with nothing but respect!

325
00:19:45,412 --> 00:19:47,687
So if you've got a problem with me--

326
00:19:47,772 --> 00:19:48,887
Are you yelling at me?

327
00:19:48,972 --> 00:19:50,007
God, no.

328
00:19:52,172 --> 00:19:55,369
You know what, Daddy?
lf you don't like Ross, that's fine.

329
00:19:55,812 --> 00:19:58,849
It doesn't matter to me.
I'm going to go out with him anyway.

330
00:19:59,492 --> 00:20:00,481
Really?

331
00:20:01,092 --> 00:20:03,322
Well, if it doesn't matter to her...

332
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:06,165
...it doesn't matter to me. Still not yelling.

333
00:20:10,052 --> 00:20:11,280
What can I say?

334
00:20:14,732 --> 00:20:16,404
This doesn't make me like you more.

335
00:20:16,492 --> 00:20:19,802
That's okay. I'm not so crazy
about myself right now either.

336
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,486
-Then we agree?
-I guess so.

337
00:20:22,572 --> 00:20:24,847
-Neither of us like Ross.
-I like Ross.

338
00:20:25,412 --> 00:20:26,288
Kids!

339
00:20:29,292 --> 00:20:32,443
Wait. I just thought of another story
about how nice Ross is.

340
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:35,126
That's okay, Rach.
We're not liking Ross right now.

341
00:20:35,212 --> 00:20:37,282
Well, I got a lot of those, too.

342
00:20:42,132 --> 00:20:44,248
It turns out you were right, C.H.E.E.S.E.

343
00:20:44,332 --> 00:20:47,688
-That shipment never made it to Omaha?
-You got it.

344
00:20:48,172 --> 00:20:51,369
And the rabbi's beard?
100 percent horse hair.

345
00:20:52,012 --> 00:20:53,684
Nice catch, C.H.E.E.S.E.

346
00:20:58,612 --> 00:21:00,443
It's your line, C.H.E.E.S.E.

347
00:21:03,372 --> 00:21:04,771
Wayne! Wayne!
