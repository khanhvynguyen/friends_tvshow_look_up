1
00:00:03,332 --> 00:00:04,526
Hi, you guys.

2
00:00:04,732 --> 00:00:06,245
What's the matter?

3
00:00:06,332 --> 00:00:09,324
Well, it's just one
of these situations that I just hate.

4
00:00:09,412 --> 00:00:12,006
You know,
a massage client gave me three tickets...

5
00:00:12,092 --> 00:00:14,845
...to the Helmut Peltz Exhibit
at the Morgan Chase Museum.

6
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:17,400
Now you're thinking
you gotta sleep with him.

7
00:00:18,092 --> 00:00:22,005
No, it's just that he gave me three tickets
and there are six of us.

8
00:00:22,092 --> 00:00:24,162
-I'll give up my ticket.
-Me, too.

9
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:26,691
Okay. That's so generous.

10
00:00:26,772 --> 00:00:28,967
And I think Ross is generous, too.

11
00:00:30,132 --> 00:00:32,043
Great! Okay. Then it's just us girls.

12
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:33,531
-Great.
-Yeah.

13
00:00:34,772 --> 00:00:36,330
So what is the exhibit?

14
00:00:36,412 --> 00:00:38,846
It's mostly just photographs of...

15
00:00:39,252 --> 00:00:43,928
...lesbian love scenes interspersed
with video games and free sandwiches.

16
00:00:47,452 --> 00:00:48,680
Oh, man!

17
00:00:52,692 --> 00:00:54,410
-Hi.
-Hi.

18
00:00:54,532 --> 00:00:55,681
Hey, Ross. Listen.

19
00:00:55,772 --> 00:00:59,765
Chandler got you out of going to the
lesbian sandwich museum this weekend.

20
00:01:01,212 --> 00:01:05,842
Thanks? But I have plans.
Elizabeth and I are going out of town.

21
00:01:05,972 --> 00:01:07,405
-That's great!
-Yeah.

22
00:01:07,492 --> 00:01:09,767
Think of all the money
that you're gonna make!

23
00:01:09,852 --> 00:01:10,807
Why? What?

24
00:01:10,892 --> 00:01:13,725
Well, her father pays you
for babysitting, right?

25
00:01:15,172 --> 00:01:17,970
No, no. That's funny.
But maybe it's time to move on.

26
00:01:18,052 --> 00:01:19,963
You know, let it go. Stop it!

27
00:01:20,612 --> 00:01:23,126
Besides, Rachel's going out
with Elizabeth's father.

28
00:01:23,212 --> 00:01:26,045
So he's much older than she is.

29
00:01:26,452 --> 00:01:29,569
Looks like I'm not the only one
interested in fossils.

30
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:35,567
Ross, all that does is remind us
that you are interested in fossils.

31
00:01:37,212 --> 00:01:38,406
Okay, okay.

32
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:42,207
Rachel's gonna need to yell sweet nothings
in his ear.

33
00:01:47,492 --> 00:01:49,881
-Ross?
-Come on! That's funny, you know?

34
00:01:49,972 --> 00:01:52,611
'Cause he's got like a hearing aid,
you know?

35
00:01:54,092 --> 00:01:56,162
'Cause he's all old.

36
00:02:03,292 --> 00:02:04,520
One second.

37
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:07,650
Okay, look, Ross.

38
00:02:09,172 --> 00:02:11,606
So you know,
since Lizzie likes you so much...

39
00:02:11,692 --> 00:02:14,081
...l've accepted the fact
that you two are dating.

40
00:02:14,172 --> 00:02:15,844
Really? Okay, that's great.

41
00:02:15,932 --> 00:02:18,127
Yeah. But then I changed my mind.

42
00:02:18,652 --> 00:02:20,210
I'm funny like that.

43
00:02:21,332 --> 00:02:23,243
I told Lizzie and now I'm telling you.

44
00:02:23,332 --> 00:02:25,800
I don't want you seeing
my daughter anymore.

45
00:02:25,892 --> 00:02:28,201
All right, look. I realize it upsets you.

46
00:02:28,292 --> 00:02:29,486
Yes, it does.

47
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:34,444
But Elizabeth and I are both adults...

48
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:38,121
...so I don't think there's really anything
you can do about it.

49
00:02:38,212 --> 00:02:41,443
I'll inform the university
of your relationship, and have you fired.

50
00:02:41,532 --> 00:02:43,329
A man with a plan!

51
00:02:46,572 --> 00:02:49,564
The One Where Paul's The Man

52
00:02:49,732 --> 00:02:50,721
English subtitles by Softitler

53
00:03:23,732 --> 00:03:27,520
This is so exciting. You get your picture
back up on the wall of fame.

54
00:03:27,612 --> 00:03:30,046
I know.
It was so cool when it was up there before.

55
00:03:30,132 --> 00:03:33,488
Me and Jim Belushi would just be
cracking up about something.

56
00:03:33,892 --> 00:03:37,089
Then I get fired off Days of Our Lives
and he takes me down.

57
00:03:37,172 --> 00:03:39,049
Now he's just laughing at me.

58
00:03:39,812 --> 00:03:42,645
Look at him. That smug Belushi bastard!

59
00:03:44,932 --> 00:03:47,685
Okay. Maybe when they put your picture
back up...

60
00:03:47,812 --> 00:03:49,848
...they could put you next to Matt Lauer.

61
00:03:49,932 --> 00:03:52,321
Look at him just smiling at me.

62
00:03:54,292 --> 00:03:56,601
Yeah, I know. We'd be great together.

63
00:04:00,692 --> 00:04:02,808
-So I'm back.
-Who are you?

64
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:06,884
Joey Tribbiani.

65
00:04:06,972 --> 00:04:08,291
From the wall?

66
00:04:08,812 --> 00:04:11,201
Okay, maybe this will jog your memory.

67
00:04:15,532 --> 00:04:16,567
Okay, anyway.

68
00:04:16,652 --> 00:04:20,281
I'm ready to go back up on the wall.
I'm the star of a new TV show.

69
00:04:21,532 --> 00:04:24,729
-Show me in the TV book.
-Well, it's not on TV yet.

70
00:04:24,812 --> 00:04:26,962
Well, then it's not on the wall yet.

71
00:04:28,452 --> 00:04:30,920
Okay, fine. I will bring you a tape.

72
00:04:33,012 --> 00:04:35,890
So, do you have any
of Matt Lauer's clothes here?

73
00:04:35,972 --> 00:04:38,611
Maybe?
Just ones that haven't been cleaned yet?

74
00:04:40,852 --> 00:04:41,841
Fine.

75
00:04:46,172 --> 00:04:47,491
I love museums.

76
00:04:47,572 --> 00:04:49,881
-Soaking up all the culture.
-Yeah.

77
00:04:49,972 --> 00:04:52,645
-Where do you want to start?
-The gift shop!

78
00:04:53,532 --> 00:04:56,569
-And then lunch.
-Yes, but I can't eat too much.

79
00:04:56,652 --> 00:05:00,850
Paul's taking me out to dinner tonight.
He said he has a big surprise planned.

80
00:05:01,132 --> 00:05:04,124
What do you think?
Maybe he's gonna tell you he's gay?

81
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:06,725
What? No, why?

82
00:05:06,812 --> 00:05:10,122
No reason. That would just be
a really big surprise, right?

83
00:05:11,052 --> 00:05:14,601
You could put the aisle over here
and have the wedding ceremony here.

84
00:05:14,692 --> 00:05:16,728
I didn't know you could get married here.

85
00:05:16,852 --> 00:05:19,127
This would be a beautiful place
to get married.

86
00:05:19,212 --> 00:05:22,682
But I wouldn't put the aisle there.
And I'd never have the ceremony there.

87
00:05:22,772 --> 00:05:25,206
You'd have the ceremony
under this beautiful arch.

88
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:26,407
May I help you?

89
00:05:27,292 --> 00:05:30,045
Sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt.
It's a beautiful space.

90
00:05:30,132 --> 00:05:32,851
-Do you do a lot of weddings here?
-Yes, we're popular.

91
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:35,127
There's a two-year waiting list. Sorry.

92
00:05:36,452 --> 00:05:39,012
You should totally put
your name down for this place.

93
00:05:39,092 --> 00:05:40,810
What? Are you crazy?

94
00:05:41,172 --> 00:05:43,891
I'm not getting married.
I'm not even engaged.

95
00:05:43,972 --> 00:05:47,123
There's a two-year wait.
What if you get engaged in two years?

96
00:05:47,212 --> 00:05:49,442
Then you've gotta wait another two years?

97
00:05:49,532 --> 00:05:52,251
That's four years.
Chandler's not gonna wait that long.

98
00:05:52,332 --> 00:05:54,323
He's gonna find somebody else, you know?

99
00:05:54,412 --> 00:05:56,801
Someone who did put their name
on the list.

100
00:05:57,932 --> 00:06:00,127
Yeah. It can't hurt to put your name down.

101
00:06:00,212 --> 00:06:03,841
I mean, in two years, if you're not engaged,
you just don't use it.

102
00:06:03,972 --> 00:06:07,009
Well, I guess there is no harm
in putting my name down.

103
00:06:07,092 --> 00:06:08,525
I'm gonna do it, too.

104
00:06:08,612 --> 00:06:09,647
Me, too!

105
00:06:10,212 --> 00:06:11,725
Really? Who would you marry?

106
00:06:11,812 --> 00:06:14,007
I don't know.
I don't have anyone right now.

107
00:06:14,092 --> 00:06:15,161
Oh, Pheebs.

108
00:06:15,812 --> 00:06:19,168
Don't feel too sorry for me.
At least my boyfriend isn't gay.

109
00:06:21,132 --> 00:06:22,451
Phoebe, that's not--

110
00:06:22,532 --> 00:06:24,648
Don't even get me started on yours.

111
00:06:27,732 --> 00:06:30,610
-So, did you watch the tape of my show?
-I did.

112
00:06:30,692 --> 00:06:34,731
-All right. Let's get me back up there.
-No. You don't go up on the wall.

113
00:06:35,532 --> 00:06:39,525
-What? But you saw the show.
-Yes. It was very offensive to my people.

114
00:06:41,812 --> 00:06:43,040
Dry cleaners?

115
00:06:45,452 --> 00:06:48,524
Russians. It showed them
as terrorists and villains.

116
00:06:48,652 --> 00:06:52,008
Okay, okay.
Look, you got Harrison Ford up there!

117
00:06:52,132 --> 00:06:54,407
That's right.
Mr. Ford is a very good customer.

118
00:06:54,492 --> 00:06:57,006
He brings us a lot of clothes.
You bring us nothing!

119
00:06:57,092 --> 00:06:58,445
Okay, that may be true.

120
00:06:58,532 --> 00:07:02,684
But in Air Force One, okay,
the Russians were terrorists and evil!

121
00:07:02,852 --> 00:07:06,208
And plus, he kills a bunch of them.
That's offensive to Russians.

122
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:07,486
I've never seen it.

123
00:07:07,572 --> 00:07:09,244
You should. It's great!

124
00:07:14,812 --> 00:07:17,246
This place is really beautiful.

125
00:07:17,452 --> 00:07:21,240
Yeah. I've been coming here since I was
a kid. This used to be my grandma's.

126
00:07:21,332 --> 00:07:24,483
The only thing I got
from my grandmother was her eyes.

127
00:07:24,972 --> 00:07:27,532
I mean, not her actual eyeballs.

128
00:07:27,652 --> 00:07:30,371
But people say that my eyes look....

129
00:07:30,692 --> 00:07:32,171
Do you want to make out?

130
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:33,241
Sure.

131
00:07:37,612 --> 00:07:38,806
Are you okay?

132
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,441
What's wrong?

133
00:07:40,532 --> 00:07:43,410
Yeah. I was just thinking
about your father.

134
00:07:44,012 --> 00:07:45,650
Well, whatever works for you.

135
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:46,721
No.

136
00:07:50,092 --> 00:07:53,004
He just really freaked me out before.

137
00:07:53,852 --> 00:07:57,049
So we have to hide our relationship
from one more person.

138
00:07:57,212 --> 00:07:58,247
Big deal.

139
00:07:58,372 --> 00:08:00,681
Besides, we've had fun hiding it.

140
00:08:00,932 --> 00:08:01,921
Yeah.

141
00:08:06,012 --> 00:08:08,480
-Yeah?
-You brought protection, right?

142
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:11,211
Why? Are there like bears or something?

143
00:08:15,852 --> 00:08:19,242
Protection. Yeah. No, yeah.
That, that I forgot.

144
00:08:20,532 --> 00:08:24,207
-I'll just run to the store and get some.
-No. I'm the guy. I'll get it.

145
00:08:24,292 --> 00:08:26,886
-Do you know where the store is?
-No.

146
00:08:26,972 --> 00:08:30,362
Do you want to ride around town
on my little pink bicycle?

147
00:08:30,852 --> 00:08:32,126
A little bit.

148
00:08:33,612 --> 00:08:35,364
-I'll be back in 10 minutes.
-Okay.

149
00:08:35,452 --> 00:08:38,524
Why don't you get in the hot tub
and I'll meet you there.

150
00:08:38,612 --> 00:08:39,601
Okay.

151
00:08:53,292 --> 00:08:57,205
Oh, my God! What a great surprise!
This is such a beautiful house!

152
00:08:57,292 --> 00:09:00,841
Thank you. It used to be my mother's.
This is the kitchen.

153
00:09:08,052 --> 00:09:09,690
You've reached Monica and Chandler's.

154
00:09:09,772 --> 00:09:12,605
If you're listening to this message,
we're probably screening.

155
00:09:12,692 --> 00:09:13,920
Yeah, we are.

156
00:09:15,332 --> 00:09:17,926
Hi, this is Hildy
from the Morgan Chase Museum.

157
00:09:18,012 --> 00:09:19,923
I'm calling for Monica Geller.

158
00:09:20,012 --> 00:09:21,843
There's been a cancellation.

159
00:09:21,932 --> 00:09:26,005
If she's still interested in having
the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility...

160
00:09:26,092 --> 00:09:27,730
...it is available.

161
00:09:28,052 --> 00:09:30,612
This is Chandler Bing!

162
00:09:31,252 --> 00:09:32,401
Yes, the groom!

163
00:09:32,492 --> 00:09:33,891
No, not the groom!

164
00:09:39,532 --> 00:09:41,204
It's so secluded up here.

165
00:09:41,972 --> 00:09:44,281
I know. That's why I like it here.

166
00:09:45,492 --> 00:09:48,370
I feel like we're the only two people
in the world.

167
00:09:50,252 --> 00:09:51,241
Sorry.

168
00:09:56,412 --> 00:09:58,084
What's the matter, honey?

169
00:09:58,532 --> 00:10:01,604
-Did you see a little mouse?
-No! Big bear! Big bear outside!

170
00:10:01,692 --> 00:10:02,727
I think l....

171
00:10:02,812 --> 00:10:05,042
Actually, would you go check on that?

172
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:07,363
Honey, we don't have any bears here.

173
00:10:07,452 --> 00:10:08,726
Well, okay.

174
00:10:08,892 --> 00:10:10,769
Would you get me a Diet Coke?

175
00:10:11,932 --> 00:10:14,082
-Okay. Be right back.
-Okay.

176
00:10:19,132 --> 00:10:21,646
-What are you doing here?
-What are you doing here?

177
00:10:21,732 --> 00:10:24,963
-I came with Paul!
-Yeah. I recognized the ankles.

178
00:10:25,052 --> 00:10:26,565
Hurry up. Get out.

179
00:10:27,532 --> 00:10:29,011
Here you go, honey.

180
00:10:30,772 --> 00:10:32,524
-Thank you!
-Diet Coke.

181
00:10:33,772 --> 00:10:34,761
Ice.

182
00:10:35,332 --> 00:10:36,845
I need ice.

183
00:10:38,692 --> 00:10:39,681
Okay.

184
00:10:40,132 --> 00:10:41,565
-Thank you.
-Be right back.

185
00:10:41,652 --> 00:10:42,641
Okay.

186
00:10:44,012 --> 00:10:45,445
You and your ice.

187
00:10:47,012 --> 00:10:49,480
Get out! Get out! Go! Come on!

188
00:10:52,372 --> 00:10:55,011
No, not in there! Not in there!
He's in there!

189
00:10:55,652 --> 00:10:57,961
-Did you really hear a bear?
-Go!

190
00:11:01,132 --> 00:11:02,565
Here you go, honey.

191
00:11:04,092 --> 00:11:06,003
One Diet Coke with ice.

192
00:11:07,612 --> 00:11:08,840
Thank you.

193
00:11:09,052 --> 00:11:12,203
I am so happy that you're here.

194
00:11:13,212 --> 00:11:15,089
-Here I am!
-Elizabeth!

195
00:11:15,532 --> 00:11:17,329
Look! Elizabeth's here!

196
00:11:19,652 --> 00:11:21,404
Who were you talking to?

197
00:11:22,092 --> 00:11:23,286
You guys?

198
00:11:25,212 --> 00:11:27,282
How did you know we were here?

199
00:11:27,412 --> 00:11:32,361
Well, she obviously saw the tire tracks
that were leading up to the closed garage.

200
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:34,841
Obviously.

201
00:11:38,052 --> 00:11:39,724
What are you doing here?

202
00:11:45,892 --> 00:11:49,248
Did you come up here to work on
that term paper or something?

203
00:11:49,532 --> 00:11:50,521
Yeah.

204
00:11:50,852 --> 00:11:54,162
Well, why don't you go in that room
and do your homework?

205
00:11:54,252 --> 00:11:57,528
I wouldn't do it in there.
That's my dad's bedroom.

206
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,882
That's your dad's bedroom.

207
00:12:03,412 --> 00:12:05,562
That's your dad's bedroom!

208
00:12:08,532 --> 00:12:10,011
Why are you yelling?

209
00:12:10,092 --> 00:12:12,765
That Diet Coke, I think,
went straight to my head!

210
00:12:18,092 --> 00:12:19,127
Hi, honey.

211
00:12:19,852 --> 00:12:21,001
See you later.

212
00:12:22,132 --> 00:12:24,726
Wait. I bought groceries.
I was gonna make you dinner.

213
00:12:24,812 --> 00:12:26,325
Well, next time, ask!

214
00:12:29,492 --> 00:12:31,448
Or at least wait for me to ask!

215
00:12:41,532 --> 00:12:44,365
Hi, this is Hildy
from the Morgan Chase Museum.

216
00:12:44,532 --> 00:12:46,284
I'm calling for Monica Geller.

217
00:12:46,372 --> 00:12:47,361
Oh, no.

218
00:12:47,612 --> 00:12:49,648
There's been a cancellation.

219
00:12:49,732 --> 00:12:53,884
If she's still interested in having
the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility...

220
00:12:53,972 --> 00:12:55,200
...it is available.

221
00:12:55,292 --> 00:12:57,044
Please. He didn't hear it!

222
00:12:57,132 --> 00:12:59,692
This is Chandler Bing!

223
00:13:01,372 --> 00:13:02,361
No!

224
00:13:05,892 --> 00:13:07,166
Can I help you?

225
00:13:07,732 --> 00:13:11,042
Yeah. Where's the guy who decides
whose pictures go up on the wall?

226
00:13:11,132 --> 00:13:14,124
-He's not here right now.
-You're kidding me!

227
00:13:14,212 --> 00:13:18,285
Well, make sure you tell him that
Joey Tribbiani dropped off these clothes.

228
00:13:18,372 --> 00:13:21,444
I'm an actor. I'm trying to get
my picture up there on the wall.

229
00:13:21,532 --> 00:13:25,002
You know, there are two people
who could get your picture up there.

230
00:13:25,692 --> 00:13:26,886
Oh, really?

231
00:13:28,212 --> 00:13:31,090
Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks.

232
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:34,043
You're the other one, right?

233
00:13:37,052 --> 00:13:39,486
So, are you planning on staying the night?

234
00:13:39,572 --> 00:13:42,882
No, no. Believe me,
I'm leaving as soon as possible.

235
00:13:43,812 --> 00:13:47,851
Good. Not that we don't want you to stay.
Obviously, you're welcome.

236
00:13:47,932 --> 00:13:50,002
How much more homework do you have?

237
00:13:51,132 --> 00:13:54,681
I just have one problem left
that I do not know how to solve.

238
00:13:54,772 --> 00:13:58,367
Rachel, maybe you want to come upstairs
and help me figure it out?

239
00:13:58,452 --> 00:13:59,441
Really?

240
00:14:00,532 --> 00:14:01,521
Okay.

241
00:14:01,812 --> 00:14:03,530
Okay, I'll go upstairs...

242
00:14:04,132 --> 00:14:07,363
...if you get me something from the car.

243
00:14:07,452 --> 00:14:09,363
What do you need from the car?

244
00:14:09,652 --> 00:14:11,085
Surprise me.

245
00:14:13,412 --> 00:14:14,401
Okay.

246
00:14:15,292 --> 00:14:18,443
So you're gonna be in the car!
I will be upstairs!

247
00:14:18,572 --> 00:14:20,847
And that's where everybody's gonna be!

248
00:14:43,652 --> 00:14:46,450
Just relax. Just relax, Paul.
You're doing great.

249
00:14:46,812 --> 00:14:48,768
She likes you.

250
00:14:49,012 --> 00:14:51,287
I think she likes you. She likes you.

251
00:14:51,652 --> 00:14:55,122
You know why?
Because you're a neat guy.

252
00:14:57,452 --> 00:14:59,044
You are the man.

253
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,688
You are the man!

254
00:15:05,852 --> 00:15:07,080
Still got it.

255
00:15:08,092 --> 00:15:09,366
Still sexy.

256
00:15:10,652 --> 00:15:12,483
You're just a love machine.

257
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:15,643
"I'm just a love machine

258
00:15:16,852 --> 00:15:20,162
"So proud of what you have, baby! "

259
00:15:29,172 --> 00:15:30,400
Showtime.

260
00:15:31,612 --> 00:15:34,604
"I'm just a love machine
Hey, baby! "

261
00:15:37,732 --> 00:15:38,721
-Phoebe?
-Yeah?

262
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,564
-Have you seen Chandler?
-No, why?

263
00:15:40,652 --> 00:15:43,450
The museum called and said
that there was a cancellation...

264
00:15:43,532 --> 00:15:46,524
...and that we could move up our wedding.
And Chandler heard.

265
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,723
I know. How bad is this?

266
00:15:48,812 --> 00:15:52,487
Well, with a regular guy it's bad.
With Chandler, oh, dear God!

267
00:15:54,292 --> 00:15:57,409
I know! He totally freaked out
and I can't find him anywhere!

268
00:15:57,492 --> 00:16:00,643
-What are you gonna do?
-I'm never listening to you again, for sure.

269
00:16:00,732 --> 00:16:03,451
"What harm can it do
to put your name down?"

270
00:16:04,732 --> 00:16:07,371
-Rachel said that.
-Well, Rachel's not here!

271
00:16:14,372 --> 00:16:15,771
Here it is!

272
00:16:16,572 --> 00:16:19,132
Joey, why did you sign it, "son of a bitch"?

273
00:16:21,892 --> 00:16:25,248
-I didn't do that. Who would've done that?
-Son of a bitch!

274
00:16:25,612 --> 00:16:27,523
Okay. Maybe ask this guy.

275
00:16:28,052 --> 00:16:29,804
You! Get out of my shop!

276
00:16:29,932 --> 00:16:32,207
-What did he do?
-He went out with my wife!

277
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:33,281
Joey!

278
00:16:35,172 --> 00:16:37,845
I did not go out with your wife! Okay?

279
00:16:37,932 --> 00:16:39,445
I went out with her.

280
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:40,965
That's my wife!

281
00:16:41,652 --> 00:16:42,641
Get out!

282
00:16:45,692 --> 00:16:47,489
-Well, we should go.
-Yeah.

283
00:16:49,852 --> 00:16:50,841
Ross?

284
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:56,126
Elizabeth!

285
00:17:00,012 --> 00:17:03,288
Okay. I'm gonna go out this window.

286
00:17:03,612 --> 00:17:07,048
I'll meet you at the front door.
Just tell them you're going home, okay?

287
00:17:07,132 --> 00:17:09,805
-Okay.
-Wait, wait! No, don't go in there!

288
00:17:09,892 --> 00:17:12,360
Don't go in there! I need another soda!

289
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:14,481
Ross!

290
00:17:16,412 --> 00:17:19,768
Oh, my God! What in heaven's name
are you doing here?

291
00:17:22,532 --> 00:17:25,888
And that is why
we cannot see each other anymore.

292
00:17:28,972 --> 00:17:32,487
Ross, you and I are gonna have
to have a little talk.

293
00:17:32,572 --> 00:17:33,846
-Daddy, l--
-You're next!

294
00:17:33,932 --> 00:17:35,888
Okay. I didn't know he was here.

295
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:40,889
Let's see if I got this straight.

296
00:17:40,972 --> 00:17:44,248
I tell you to stay away
from my daughter or I'll have you fired.

297
00:17:44,332 --> 00:17:46,721
What you heard was: "Take my daughter...

298
00:17:46,812 --> 00:17:49,849
"...come up to my country house
and ruin my weekend with Rachel."

299
00:17:49,932 --> 00:17:54,403
-Okay. Please, Paul. Just let me explain.
-No! Let me explain! Fired!

300
00:17:55,852 --> 00:17:58,412
Okay, fine. Fine. Have me fired.

301
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:02,328
But, I want you to know...

302
00:18:02,972 --> 00:18:06,328
...that you and I are not all that different.
I mean...

303
00:18:07,532 --> 00:18:10,126
...l, too, am a "neat guy."

304
00:18:19,412 --> 00:18:20,401
What?

305
00:18:22,572 --> 00:18:24,051
And l, too...

306
00:18:24,572 --> 00:18:26,688
...am "just a love machine."

307
00:18:49,492 --> 00:18:52,290
-Let me show you where the guest room is.
-Okay.

308
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,690
I'm so sorry. Please stop freaking out.

309
00:19:06,652 --> 00:19:08,165
I'm not freaking out.

310
00:19:10,372 --> 00:19:11,691
Why would I freak out?

311
00:19:11,812 --> 00:19:13,962
Hildy called and said
we were getting married.

312
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:15,849
But that happens every day.

313
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:21,886
Honey, we were at this beautiful place.

314
00:19:21,972 --> 00:19:24,122
And I just put our names down for fun.

315
00:19:24,212 --> 00:19:26,931
-I mean, what's the harm in that?
-Right here.

316
00:19:29,372 --> 00:19:31,966
Please don't think I was trying
to pressure you.

317
00:19:32,052 --> 00:19:34,361
-Phoebe and Rachel thought--
-Phoebe and Rachel?

318
00:19:34,452 --> 00:19:37,808
So the people that knew
about our wedding before me were you...

319
00:19:37,892 --> 00:19:42,363
...Phoebe, Rachel, Hildy, and some band
called, Star Light Magic Seven...

320
00:19:42,452 --> 00:19:44,522
...who are available, by the way.

321
00:19:46,572 --> 00:19:47,925
It was a mistake.

322
00:19:48,212 --> 00:19:51,602
Please don't take this to mean anything,
because it doesn't.

323
00:19:54,292 --> 00:19:55,327
Okay.

324
00:19:56,212 --> 00:19:57,247
Really?

325
00:19:58,212 --> 00:20:01,761
Yes. If it really doesn't mean anything,
because I'm just not ready.

326
00:20:01,852 --> 00:20:02,841
I know.

327
00:20:03,292 --> 00:20:04,361
I know.

328
00:20:05,172 --> 00:20:06,161
Okay.

329
00:20:07,052 --> 00:20:08,121
All right.

330
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,971
I'm gonna go tell Joey that you're back.

331
00:20:11,052 --> 00:20:13,247
We were really worried about you.

332
00:20:18,532 --> 00:20:20,090
Did she buy it?

333
00:20:20,692 --> 00:20:21,727
Totally.

334
00:20:21,812 --> 00:20:24,963
-So did Hildy show you the place?
-Yeah. It's beautiful.

335
00:20:26,452 --> 00:20:29,091
I can't believe
you're gonna ask Monica to marry you.

336
00:20:29,172 --> 00:20:30,207
I know.

337
00:20:40,972 --> 00:20:43,486
-Hey, Gunther.
-Take these cappuccinos to table 1 1 .

338
00:20:43,572 --> 00:20:46,086
And that guy over there wants
some biscotti.

339
00:20:46,532 --> 00:20:49,922
Well, I just actually came in
for a cup of coffee to go.

340
00:20:51,172 --> 00:20:52,810
Do you still work here?

341
00:20:54,092 --> 00:20:56,560
No. I quit a long time ago.

342
00:20:57,332 --> 00:20:59,800
Did I forget to tell you that? I'm sorry.

343
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:03,170
-That's cool. I was gonna fire you anyway.
-Great!
