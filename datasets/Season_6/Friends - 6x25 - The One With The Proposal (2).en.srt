1
00:00:04,732 --> 00:00:06,609
What? What did you-- What?

2
00:00:08,532 --> 00:00:10,045
I still love you.

3
00:00:10,292 --> 00:00:13,568
I know I shouldn't even
be here telling you this.

4
00:00:13,812 --> 00:00:15,928
You're with Chandler,
who I really like.

5
00:00:16,172 --> 00:00:18,003
You say he's straight,
I'll believe you.

6
00:00:20,092 --> 00:00:23,767
After seeing you, I knew if I didn't
tell you I'd always regret it.

7
00:00:24,012 --> 00:00:26,970
Letting you go was
the stupidest thing I ever did.

8
00:00:28,292 --> 00:00:30,726
You're really not
supposed to be back here.

9
00:00:31,372 --> 00:00:35,729
I'm sorry. I know this is
the wrong time and the wrong place. . .

10
00:00:35,932 --> 00:00:37,684
. . .but I had to tell you.

11
00:00:38,212 --> 00:00:40,601
I want to spend my life with you
and marry you.

12
00:00:42,572 --> 00:00:44,051
I want to have kids with you.

13
00:00:48,012 --> 00:00:50,321
Why don't they put chairs back here?

14
00:00:51,812 --> 00:00:54,849
I know this is crazy,
but am I too late?

15
00:00:55,332 --> 00:00:58,642
Yes, you're too late.
Where was all this three years ago?

16
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,167
I know. I was an idiot.

17
00:01:01,412 --> 00:01:03,642
And I tried to forget you.
I really did.

18
00:01:03,892 --> 00:01:08,488
After we had lunch last year, I spent
six months in Africa trying to forget.

19
00:01:09,012 --> 00:01:11,924
-What were you doing in Africa?
-Working with blind kids.

20
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:14,527
What are you doing to me?

21
00:01:15,012 --> 00:01:16,525
Look, l. . . .

22
00:01:16,772 --> 00:01:20,162
I'm sorry,
but it's not gonna happen.

23
00:01:20,412 --> 00:01:23,768
That's fine. I'll walk away.
And I'll never bother you again.

24
00:01:24,012 --> 00:01:27,687
Only if you tell me Chandler's
willing to give you everything I am.

25
00:01:28,212 --> 00:01:30,726
Well, he is. I mean. . .

26
00:01:30,932 --> 00:01:33,162
. . .marriage is all he talks about.

27
00:01:34,572 --> 00:01:37,132
In fact, I'm the one
making him wait.

28
00:01:37,372 --> 00:01:39,124
You are? Why?

29
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:40,526
Why?

30
00:01:41,532 --> 00:01:43,329
Because of the government.

31
00:01:45,252 --> 00:01:47,402
The One With The Proposal - Part 2

33
00:02:23,092 --> 00:02:25,128
Isn't it incredible?

34
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:28,245
Monica and Chandler
are getting married.

35
00:02:28,492 --> 00:02:31,404
I know. They'll be so happy together.

36
00:02:31,812 --> 00:02:34,406
Two best friends in love.
How often does that happen?

37
00:02:34,652 --> 00:02:36,529
-Not that often.
-No.

38
00:02:37,492 --> 00:02:39,005
I'm so happy for them.

39
00:02:39,252 --> 00:02:41,561
Me too. So happy for them.

40
00:02:42,212 --> 00:02:44,521
I'm so happy and not at all jealous.

41
00:02:45,092 --> 00:02:48,528
Oh, no! God, definitely not jealous.

42
00:02:53,212 --> 00:02:57,125
I'm probably 98% happy
and maybe 2% jealous.

43
00:02:57,412 --> 00:02:58,845
What's 2%? That's nothing.

44
00:02:59,092 --> 00:03:00,525
Totally.

45
00:03:03,132 --> 00:03:05,441
-I'm like 90-1 0.
-Yeah. Me too.

46
00:03:10,132 --> 00:03:12,123
Have you guys seen Chandler?

47
00:03:15,572 --> 00:03:18,132
No. But you know who
was looking for you?

48
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:19,526
Tenille.

49
00:03:27,092 --> 00:03:29,925
So that marriage stuff
you were saying yesterday?

50
00:03:30,132 --> 00:03:32,600
-You don't really believe that.
-Sure, I do.

51
00:03:32,852 --> 00:03:36,288
In fact, I think the whole concept
of marriage is unnatural.

52
00:03:36,812 --> 00:03:40,122
Look at pigs. Let's take
a second here and look at pigs.

53
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,570
Pigs don't mate for life.

54
00:03:42,812 --> 00:03:46,248
A pig can have 1 00 sexual partners
in a lifetime.

55
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:50,326
And that's just an ordinary pig,
not even a pig that's good at sports.

56
00:03:51,412 --> 00:03:52,731
Wait a minute.

57
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:56,729
Are you telling me
you may never want to get married?

58
00:03:56,932 --> 00:03:59,366
Never say never, but, probably. . .

59
00:03:59,612 --> 00:04:00,965
. . .yeah, never.

60
00:04:01,932 --> 00:04:03,126
Oh, my God.

61
00:04:03,372 --> 00:04:06,045
Then what are we even doing?
What is this?

62
00:04:06,292 --> 00:04:09,523
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What is all this pressure?

63
00:04:10,092 --> 00:04:11,764
Is this some new strategy?

64
00:04:12,012 --> 00:04:15,561
Why don't you put down your copy
of The Rules, huh, man-trap?

65
00:04:17,012 --> 00:04:18,923
You know what? I gotta go.

66
00:04:21,132 --> 00:04:23,521
It's okay. I got a plan.

67
00:04:28,932 --> 00:04:31,492
-We're gonna find love.
-Definitely.

68
00:04:33,012 --> 00:04:35,526
Yeah, I'm pretty confident about that.

69
00:04:36,092 --> 00:04:40,131
That's what makes it so easy to be
80% happy for Monica and Chandler.

70
00:04:41,332 --> 00:04:44,130
-Would be nice to have a guarantee.
-What do you mean?

71
00:04:44,372 --> 00:04:46,522
Some people make deals with a friend.

72
00:04:46,772 --> 00:04:51,163
Like if neither of them are married
by 40, they marry each other.

73
00:04:51,452 --> 00:04:52,965
-You mean a backup?
-Exactly.

74
00:04:53,212 --> 00:04:54,884
I've got that.

75
00:04:56,412 --> 00:04:57,765
You do?

76
00:04:58,012 --> 00:04:59,206
-Who?
-Joey?

77
00:04:59,452 --> 00:05:02,250
Joey? Are you serious?

78
00:05:02,492 --> 00:05:04,084
I locked him in years ago.

79
00:05:07,132 --> 00:05:11,967
Wait. So if neither of you are
married by 40, you'll marry Joey?

80
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:13,850
Yep. We shook on it.

81
00:05:14,532 --> 00:05:18,320
But believe me, that is not
how he wanted to seal the deal.

82
00:05:19,492 --> 00:05:20,925
Seriously?

83
00:05:21,132 --> 00:05:23,009
I think his exact words were. . . .

84
00:05:25,652 --> 00:05:26,846
Charming.

85
00:05:27,692 --> 00:05:29,728
He's just a backup.

86
00:05:37,572 --> 00:05:38,721
Hey, Monica.

87
00:05:38,932 --> 00:05:41,048
Have you seen Rachel?
Or a mirror?

88
00:05:42,532 --> 00:05:44,204
It's for my boat. Cool, huh?

89
00:05:44,852 --> 00:05:46,046
Yeah, it's great.

90
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:48,681
What's the matter?
Talk to the captain.

91
00:05:50,692 --> 00:05:53,843
Just realizing
I'm in a dead-end relationship.

92
00:05:54,172 --> 00:05:55,730
He's giving you a hard time?

93
00:05:55,932 --> 00:05:59,129
I don't want to get married tomorrow.
But I want to believe. . .

94
00:05:59,332 --> 00:06:02,244
. . .we're going somewhere,
that I'm not wasting my time.

95
00:06:02,492 --> 00:06:05,450
-You know Chandler.
-No, I don't know Chandler.

96
00:06:05,692 --> 00:06:09,605
Not anymore.
It's like something's changed.

97
00:06:09,852 --> 00:06:11,046
Maybe you changed.

98
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:13,291
I didn't change.

99
00:06:13,772 --> 00:06:15,330
Maybe that's the problem.

100
00:06:17,012 --> 00:06:19,731
-What?
-Chandler is a complex fellow.

101
00:06:19,972 --> 00:06:22,532
One who is unlikely to take a wife.

102
00:06:25,332 --> 00:06:28,449
Does he think I'll just
wait around for nothing?

103
00:06:28,692 --> 00:06:31,570
Face it.
Chandler is against marriage.

104
00:06:31,812 --> 00:06:33,723
And always will be.

105
00:06:34,892 --> 00:06:37,531
Well, there's some people
who do want to marry me.

106
00:06:37,732 --> 00:06:40,087
-There are?
-Yeah. Richard.

107
00:06:40,492 --> 00:06:42,369
Richard said he wants to marry you?

108
00:06:44,052 --> 00:06:46,885
-And Chandler says he hates marriage?
-That's right.

109
00:06:47,692 --> 00:06:49,603
Chandler loves marriage!

110
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:53,848
You just told me he hates marriage!

111
00:06:54,092 --> 00:06:57,448
That he's a complex fellow
who's unlikely to take a wife!

112
00:06:57,692 --> 00:07:00,126
That he's against marriage
and always will be!

113
00:07:00,572 --> 00:07:02,642
You got that from what I said?

114
00:07:09,532 --> 00:07:11,921
-Rach.
-Hey, you.

115
00:07:13,412 --> 00:07:14,925
-Come on in.
-Thank you.

116
00:07:15,412 --> 00:07:18,245
I'm so sorry
to hear about you and Elizabeth.

117
00:07:18,492 --> 00:07:22,326
Thanks. Yeah, I really thought
we'd be able to make it work.

118
00:07:22,572 --> 00:07:24,563
I guess it just wasn't meant to be.

119
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:26,291
Yeah. Love.

120
00:07:27,092 --> 00:07:29,128
It's a tricky business, isn't it?

121
00:07:30,212 --> 00:07:31,406
I guess so.

122
00:07:31,812 --> 00:07:33,962
So what do you say we make a pact?

123
00:07:34,212 --> 00:07:37,568
If you and I are both single by 40,
we get married.

124
00:07:37,812 --> 00:07:40,724
I mean, we know each other,
we like each other. . .

125
00:07:40,972 --> 00:07:44,760
. . .we've already slept together,
so there'll be no surprises there.

126
00:07:45,012 --> 00:07:46,650
No, like, "What's that?"

127
00:07:49,812 --> 00:07:53,885
-Oh, you want me to be your backup.
-Exactly.

128
00:07:54,132 --> 00:07:56,123
Yeah. I already have one.

129
00:07:57,612 --> 00:07:58,806
-Who?
-Phoebe.

130
00:07:59,052 --> 00:08:00,246
Phoebe?

131
00:08:01,092 --> 00:08:03,731
But she just said Joey is her backup.

132
00:08:03,972 --> 00:08:06,122
Oh, I don't think so.

133
00:08:06,892 --> 00:08:10,521
I just spoke with her. She said
that she and Joey made a deal.

134
00:08:10,772 --> 00:08:13,570
That's impossible.
We have had a deal for years.

135
00:08:13,812 --> 00:08:15,165
We shook on it.

136
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:18,722
Although, believe me,
she wanted to do a lot more than that.

137
00:08:22,932 --> 00:08:24,126
Where have you been?

138
00:08:25,012 --> 00:08:27,890
I was making a coconut phone
with the Professor.

139
00:08:29,772 --> 00:08:32,605
Richard told Monica
he wants to marry her.

140
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:34,769
-What?
-I've been looking for you.

141
00:08:35,012 --> 00:08:36,331
Stop messing with her!

142
00:08:36,572 --> 00:08:40,167
And I would have if these damn
boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!

143
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,848
-Oh, my God!
-I know! They suck!

144
00:08:43,892 --> 00:08:46,770
He's not supposed to ask her
to marry him! I am!

145
00:08:47,012 --> 00:08:48,331
-I know!
-What--?

146
00:08:48,532 --> 00:08:52,127
You know what I'll do?
I'll go over there and kick his ass!

147
00:08:52,492 --> 00:08:53,925
Will you help me?

148
00:08:55,732 --> 00:08:58,565
Look, us getting our asses kicked
is not a solution.

149
00:09:00,772 --> 00:09:04,003
-Look, just go and find Monica.
-You're right.

150
00:09:04,572 --> 00:09:06,369
I'm gonna get the ring. . .

151
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:07,965
. . .I'll go find her. . .

152
00:09:08,372 --> 00:09:09,566
. . .and I'll propose!

153
00:09:10,372 --> 00:09:11,646
Dude! Dude! Dude!

154
00:09:12,692 --> 00:09:15,729
That coconut phone
might be good for the boat.

155
00:09:31,412 --> 00:09:32,606
Hi.

156
00:09:35,052 --> 00:09:36,246
Hi.

157
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:40,604
I don't know why I'm here.

158
00:09:41,292 --> 00:09:42,771
I didn't ask.

159
00:09:45,172 --> 00:09:46,525
You want to come in?

160
00:09:46,772 --> 00:09:48,125
I don't know.

161
00:09:48,972 --> 00:09:50,530
Oh, okay.

162
00:09:51,372 --> 00:09:54,330
I'll just leave the door open
and go sit on the couch.

163
00:09:56,812 --> 00:09:58,530
Chandler is such an idiot!

164
00:09:58,772 --> 00:09:59,966
Drink?

165
00:10:01,212 --> 00:10:03,567
-Scotch on the--
-Rocks with a twist?

166
00:10:04,372 --> 00:10:05,725
I remember.

167
00:10:08,492 --> 00:10:10,528
You still smoking cigars?

168
00:10:11,412 --> 00:10:13,721
No. That's art.

169
00:10:15,412 --> 00:10:17,642
If it bothers you,
I can put my art out.

170
00:10:18,972 --> 00:10:20,928
No, that's okay.

171
00:10:23,212 --> 00:10:24,725
So, Monica. . .

172
00:10:25,012 --> 00:10:26,650
. . .Iet me ask you a question.

173
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:29,042
Since we broke up, do you ever. . .

174
00:10:29,332 --> 00:10:30,481
. . .think about me?

175
00:10:32,092 --> 00:10:34,925
Actually, I thought about you
a couple months ago.

176
00:10:35,172 --> 00:10:37,163
-Really?
-Yeah, but it's because l. . .

177
00:10:37,412 --> 00:10:40,722
. . .had an eye exam,
and I don't like my new eye doctor.

178
00:10:42,012 --> 00:10:43,445
-Who is it?
-Edward Nevsky.

179
00:10:43,692 --> 00:10:45,091
Yeah, he's no good.

180
00:10:47,092 --> 00:10:50,129
Do you ever think about me in. . .

181
00:10:50,932 --> 00:10:52,411
. . .a non-eye-doctor way?

182
00:10:52,692 --> 00:10:53,886
No.

183
00:10:58,212 --> 00:11:01,921
Because getting over you was
the hardest thing I've ever had to do.

184
00:11:02,612 --> 00:11:04,682
I never let myself think about you.

185
00:11:12,092 --> 00:11:14,811
Phoebe, you picked Joey and Ross?

186
00:11:15,052 --> 00:11:16,644
You can't have two backups!

187
00:11:17,292 --> 00:11:18,850
Of course I can.

188
00:11:19,092 --> 00:11:21,560
It's just good sense
to back up your backup.

189
00:11:21,812 --> 00:11:24,372
-Look, I've already lost Chandler.
-What?

190
00:11:25,212 --> 00:11:26,440
Hey, Phoebe!

191
00:11:26,692 --> 00:11:27,920
We're both backups?

192
00:11:28,132 --> 00:11:30,646
How could you do this to me?

193
00:11:31,332 --> 00:11:35,325
What are you complaining about?
You were both aware of the situation.

194
00:11:35,572 --> 00:11:37,369
-I was not!
-No, we weren't!

195
00:11:37,612 --> 00:11:41,082
This kind of back talk
isn't gonna fly when we're married.

196
00:11:41,932 --> 00:11:43,923
You can't have both. Pick one.

197
00:11:44,172 --> 00:11:45,571
-Pick me!
-No, pick me!

198
00:11:45,812 --> 00:11:48,326
I don't want to end up an old maid.

199
00:11:49,532 --> 00:11:50,760
Well, let's see.

200
00:11:51,012 --> 00:11:53,128
Ross is a good father.

201
00:11:53,372 --> 00:11:54,566
But. . .

202
00:11:54,812 --> 00:11:57,087
. . .Joey has a boat. This is hard.

203
00:11:57,332 --> 00:11:59,448
This is crazy.
I want to switch to Rachel.

204
00:11:59,692 --> 00:12:00,966
I want to switch too.

205
00:12:01,212 --> 00:12:03,089
No, wait!

206
00:12:03,812 --> 00:12:06,770
Wait, guys.
Don't make any rash decisions.

207
00:12:07,012 --> 00:12:08,923
Remember my promise:

208
00:12:09,132 --> 00:12:12,010
If we get married,
three times a week.

209
00:12:12,252 --> 00:12:13,731
Oh, my God. Phoebe. . . .

210
00:12:13,972 --> 00:12:16,247
I'm talking about massages.

211
00:12:16,492 --> 00:12:18,562
No, I'm not.

212
00:12:21,572 --> 00:12:24,166
I know how to settle this.
Here's what we'll do.

213
00:12:24,412 --> 00:12:26,528
I'll write "Joey" . . .

214
00:12:26,732 --> 00:12:27,960
. . .on one napkin.

215
00:12:28,212 --> 00:12:30,965
And I'm going to write "Ross"
on the other napkin. . .

216
00:12:31,212 --> 00:12:32,770
. . .and we'll pick one.

217
00:12:33,012 --> 00:12:35,321
That person will be our backup.
Here we go.

218
00:12:35,532 --> 00:12:37,124
-That sounds fair.
-All right.

219
00:12:37,372 --> 00:12:38,851
Good. Switching them up.

220
00:12:43,092 --> 00:12:44,730
-Pick one.
-Left.

221
00:12:45,692 --> 00:12:47,728
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

222
00:12:49,892 --> 00:12:52,122
-Ross.
-Joey.

223
00:12:54,332 --> 00:12:56,243
-We should just switch.
-Absolutely.

224
00:12:59,772 --> 00:13:01,524
I miss this apartment.

225
00:13:01,732 --> 00:13:03,962
Now, this is a grownup's apartment.

226
00:13:04,212 --> 00:13:06,487
I should be with a grownup, you know?

227
00:13:06,892 --> 00:13:10,851
You're saying you need to be
with someone more mature.

228
00:13:11,412 --> 00:13:12,606
Maybe someone with. . .

229
00:13:13,972 --> 00:13:16,532
. . .a license to practice medicine.

230
00:13:16,812 --> 00:13:18,450
Or a mustache.

231
00:13:19,812 --> 00:13:22,326
Let's face it. I'm not a kid anymore.

232
00:13:22,572 --> 00:13:25,325
I need to be with someone
who wants the same things.

233
00:13:25,532 --> 00:13:29,730
Coming to my work and telling me
you love me, I want that!

234
00:13:30,372 --> 00:13:33,921
Talking about pig sex over lunch,
I don't want that!

235
00:13:35,212 --> 00:13:36,725
I think that's fair.

236
00:13:36,932 --> 00:13:39,924
Fair? Please.
Don't even talk to me about fair.

237
00:13:40,172 --> 00:13:42,925
Fair would've been you
wanting to marry me then.

238
00:13:43,172 --> 00:13:45,447
Or Chandler wanting to marry me now.

239
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:48,923
Believe me, nothing about this
is fair. Nothing.

240
00:13:49,172 --> 00:13:51,925
-Nothing! Nothing!
-It's okay.

241
00:13:56,132 --> 00:13:57,724
Nothing.

242
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:03,286
I don't know.

243
00:14:03,572 --> 00:14:05,130
I don't know.

244
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:07,406
I know.

245
00:14:11,412 --> 00:14:13,767
I have to figure. . .

246
00:14:14,012 --> 00:14:16,480
. . .some stuff, before I can. . . .

247
00:14:16,692 --> 00:14:18,125
I understand.

248
00:14:19,212 --> 00:14:21,328
Take as much time as you want.

249
00:14:22,212 --> 00:14:24,089
1 0, 20 minutes, if you need it.

250
00:14:25,772 --> 00:14:28,366
I'll be here. Not smoking.

251
00:14:44,492 --> 00:14:45,925
Where is she?

252
00:14:46,172 --> 00:14:47,969
I'm not scared of you.

253
00:14:49,772 --> 00:14:52,332
She's not here. And please come in.

254
00:14:53,612 --> 00:14:54,931
Scotch on the rocks. . .

255
00:14:55,132 --> 00:14:57,441
. . .with a twist, on a coaster.

256
00:14:57,692 --> 00:14:59,125
Monica?

257
00:15:00,932 --> 00:15:03,207
Okay, she was here. But she left.

258
00:15:03,452 --> 00:15:04,771
Where did she go?

259
00:15:05,012 --> 00:15:07,401
She said she had to think things over.

260
00:15:07,772 --> 00:15:11,845
Oh, my God. I can't believe this.
I thought you were a good guy.

261
00:15:12,092 --> 00:15:13,764
Look, nothing happened.

262
00:15:14,012 --> 00:15:17,721
Nothing happened? Nothing?
You didn't tell her you love her?

263
00:15:17,972 --> 00:15:20,532
Well, all right, one thing happened.

264
00:15:21,012 --> 00:15:22,525
You know what you did?

265
00:15:22,732 --> 00:15:24,927
My girlfriend is thinking things over.

266
00:15:25,172 --> 00:15:27,288
You made my girlfriend think!

267
00:15:28,932 --> 00:15:30,524
Well, I'm sorry.

268
00:15:31,812 --> 00:15:33,643
What's to think about? I love her.

269
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:37,771
Well, apparently I'm willing
to offer her things that you are not.

270
00:15:38,012 --> 00:15:41,209
I'm willing to offer her those things.
This was just a plan.

271
00:15:41,452 --> 00:15:45,809
To throw her off so when I offered
all these things, she'd be surprised.

272
00:15:46,932 --> 00:15:49,844
If it helps, it worked very well.

273
00:15:50,732 --> 00:15:53,724
It was working till you showed up,
you big tree.

274
00:15:56,332 --> 00:15:58,129
This isn't fair.

275
00:15:58,372 --> 00:16:01,648
You had your chance with her,
and you blew it!

276
00:16:01,892 --> 00:16:03,928
This is my chance
and I won't blow it. . .

277
00:16:04,132 --> 00:16:06,327
. . .because we are
meant for each other.

278
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:09,729
And this has all just been
one stupid mistake!

279
00:16:10,412 --> 00:16:12,528
I was gonna propose tonight.

280
00:16:15,292 --> 00:16:16,486
You were?

281
00:16:17,292 --> 00:16:18,725
Yeah, I even. . .

282
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:20,806
. . .got a ring.

283
00:16:21,492 --> 00:16:22,925
Did you get a ring?

284
00:16:23,252 --> 00:16:24,810
No, I don't have a ring.

285
00:16:30,212 --> 00:16:31,406
You go get her.

286
00:16:34,772 --> 00:16:37,127
And can I give you a piece of advice?

287
00:16:37,412 --> 00:16:39,130
If you do get her. . .

288
00:16:40,172 --> 00:16:41,764
. . .don't let her go.

289
00:16:42,012 --> 00:16:43,365
Trust me.

290
00:16:46,212 --> 00:16:49,522
You know, Richard,
you are a good guy.

291
00:16:51,812 --> 00:16:53,131
I know.

292
00:16:54,212 --> 00:16:55,565
I hate that.

293
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,967
-I've gotta find Monica.
-She's gone.

294
00:17:12,412 --> 00:17:15,609
-What?
-She had a bag and she left.

295
00:17:15,852 --> 00:17:17,729
-What?
-She was crying.

296
00:17:17,972 --> 00:17:21,044
She said you want different things
and she needs to think.

297
00:17:21,292 --> 00:17:23,567
Why didn't you tell her it was a plan?

298
00:17:23,812 --> 00:17:26,929
I did! I told her everything.
She wouldn't believe me.

299
00:17:28,452 --> 00:17:29,646
Where did she go?

300
00:17:29,892 --> 00:17:32,326
To her parents.
She said you shouldn't call.

301
00:17:32,572 --> 00:17:34,927
But if I were you, I would.

302
00:17:35,572 --> 00:17:37,051
Can't believe I ruined this.

303
00:17:37,412 --> 00:17:39,528
I am so sorry, man.

304
00:17:50,372 --> 00:17:52,169
You wanted it to be a surprise.

305
00:18:02,132 --> 00:18:03,645
Oh, my God.

306
00:18:10,012 --> 00:18:11,331
Chandler. . .

307
00:18:12,732 --> 00:18:14,529
. . .in all my life. . .

308
00:18:15,332 --> 00:18:17,721
. . .I never thought
I would be so lucky. . .

309
00:18:21,212 --> 00:18:24,727
. . .as to fall in love
with my best. . .

310
00:18:26,012 --> 00:18:27,525
. . .my best. . . .

311
00:18:28,612 --> 00:18:31,331
There's a reason why
girls don't do this!

312
00:18:32,332 --> 00:18:34,926
I'll do it. I thought. . . .

313
00:18:39,012 --> 00:18:40,570
Wait, I can do this.

314
00:18:44,412 --> 00:18:47,324
I thought that it mattered. . .

315
00:18:47,532 --> 00:18:50,922
. . .what I said or where I said it.

316
00:18:51,612 --> 00:18:53,523
Then I realized. . .

317
00:18:53,972 --> 00:18:56,930
. . .the only thing that matters
is that you. . .

318
00:19:00,412 --> 00:19:04,564
. . .you make me happier
than I ever thought I could be.

00:19:07,572 --> 00:19:09,528
And if you let me. . .

320
00:19:10,172 --> 00:19:14,131
. . .I will spend the rest of my life
trying to make you feel the same way.

321
00:19:22,772 --> 00:19:24,330
Monica. . .

Yes.

I knew you were likely to take a wife!

325
00:19:49,572 --> 00:19:51,961
Can we come in yet?
We're dying out here!

This is the least jealous
I've ever been!

329
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:11,244
Oh, no, wait! This is wrong!
Ross isn't here!

330
